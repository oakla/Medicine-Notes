# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
 Describe the four different types of transplant donor and understand
the requirement for immunosuppressive therapy in each type
 Understand that the recipients (adaptive) immune system will
recognize an allograft as foreign and attempt to destroy it, causing
rejection
 Describe the characteristics of the rejection response that indicate it
is mostly mediated by cells of the adaptive immune system
 Understand that the target(s) for rejection are molecules which are
genetically different between the individuals, particularly HLA
molecules
 Understand that Immunosuppressive medications taken to prevent
rejection affect the entire immune system, making the recipient
vulnerable to infectious pathogens (and cancers)

## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes
4 types of transplant; 
- autologous
- isologous
- homologous (allograft)
- heterologous (xenograft)


Allograft rejection is mostly due 
- to response of the adpative immune system. 
- differences in HLA molecules

[[Major Histocompatibility Complex|HLA]] vary more across racial/ethnicity lines
