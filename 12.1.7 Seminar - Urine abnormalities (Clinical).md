## haematuria
How to confirm haematuria?
- UA is non - specific

If pos - Dx?
- think anatomically (niel's advice)


Tests3 buckets: to find out
- diagnosis
- severity
- context (other diseases they have and impacts)

What tests to diagnoses?
- Mind Stream Urine (can show blood and infection)
- Imaging (ultra sound)
- cystoscopy - diagnose bladder cancer - unlikely for <40yo

### What can you see in urine microscopy?

RBC morphology indicates where the RBC enters urine
- disformed => RBC has passed through the nephron - subject to hyper-osmolarity

Casts
- cylinderical protein solids cast in uretha shape


Case 1 again
- MSU confirms microscopic haematuria
	- RBC morph suggest they're from kidney
- ultra sound shows nothing
	- negative result suggests bleed/injury/condition must be microscopic
- => most likely diag is something secondary to glomerulonephritis
	- most commonly 
		- IgA nephropathy
		- Thin Basement Membrane Disease
Prognosistic markers
- **A**CR, **B**P, **C**reatinine (ABC)

## Case 2
- proteinuria
how to quantify
- spot urine test - use ratios - measure relative to creatinine

## Case 3

- ACR
- lipids
- serum albumin

## Take Aways

- 4 most common main diseases
	- given symtoms (haemat/protein-uria) highly correlate with age (see slide)
