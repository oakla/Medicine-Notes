## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes


## Long Term Hormonal regulation BP
- Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system
	- Raises BP by vasoconstriction and secretion of aldosterone (↑Na+/water retention, ↑blood vol.)
- Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)
	- Released by cells of atria (stretch)
	- Lowers BP by causing vasodilation and promoting loss of salt and water in urine (↓blood vol.)
- Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) aka vasopressin
	- Produced by hypothalamus  post. pituitary
	- Response to dehydration or decreased blood volume
	- Causes vasoconstriction + increased water retention (↑blood vol., ↑BP )
