## Overview
### Learning Outcomes
• [[#Describe the main classes of anti-arrhythmics (Class 1-4 and unclassified), and their mechanism of action and effect on the cardiac action potential]]
• [[#Recognise that not all anti-arrythmics can be neatly classified (unclassified) such as with digoxin, adenosine and magnesium]]
• [[#Recognise that antiarrythmics have the potential to be pro-arrythmic]]
• [[#Recognise the potential for other non-arrythmic adverse effects, as illustrated with amiodarone and digoxin]]
