# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
• Describe the main classes of anti-arrhythmics (Class 1-4 and unclassified), and their mechanism of action and effect on the cardiac action potential
• Recognise that not all anti-arrythmics can be neatly classified (unclassified) such as with digoxin, adenosine and magnesium
• Recognise that antiarrhythmics have the potential to be pro-arrythmic
• Recognise the potential for other non-arrythmic adverse effects, as illustrated with amiodarone and digoxin

## Outline/Sections
- Physiology – Conduction and the action potential
- Arrythmias and antiarrhythmics
	- Classification
		- Vaughan Williams (1-4)

# Notes

two important groups
- pace maker cells
- normal conducting cells

Antiarrythmics can cause arrythmia
- **decreased** conduction velocity requires **increased** refractory period to prevent 'reentry'

Fast Channel and Slow Channel

## Class 1-4 and unclassified, and their mechanism of action and effect on the cardiac action potential

4 classes:
1. Na channel blockers
2. beta-1 blockers
3. K channel blockers
4. Ca blockers
Unclassified:
- Digitalis glycosides (Digoxin)
- Adenosine
- Mg


antiarrhythmics work by 
- blocking ions channels (Na),
- blocking receptors (beta-blockers)

### Class 1. Voltage gated **Sodium channel blockers**
3 sub-classes
- 1a - oldest
- 1b - still used ([[ligocaine]])
- 1c - 'relatively' steady state ([[Flecainide]])
	- Causes lengthening of PR and QRS intervals

### Class 2. Autonomic inhibitors / Antisympathetics ([[Beta blockers]])
- [[catecholamines]]
- work by antagonism of beta-adrenoreceptors
2nd gen was Beta-1 selective

Side effects:
- decompensation?
- brachycardia
- exacerbation of asthma caused by *imperfect* B-1 spec (B-2 blockade happens)
- impairs body's SNS ability to regulate hypoglecymia - "Blunting of physiological counter-regulatory adrenergic response"
### Class 3. Prolong action potential. Potassium channel blockers

Amiodarone is K blocker but also has activity of other classes

### Class 4. Calcium channel blockers


## Recognise that not all anti-arrythmics can be neatly classified (unclassified) such as with digoxin, adenosine and magnesium

## Recognise that antiarrythmics have the potential to be pro-arrythmic
- it's true
## Recognise the potential for other non-arrythmic adverse effects, as illustrated with amiodarone and digoxin
