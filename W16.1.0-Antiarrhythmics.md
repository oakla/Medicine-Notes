# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
• [[#Describe the main classes of anti-arrhythmics (Class 1-4 and unclassified), and their mechanism of action and effect on the cardiac action potential]]
• [[#Recognise that not all anti-arrythmics can be neatly classified (unclassified) such as with digoxin, adenosine and magnesium]]
• [[#Recognise that antiarrhythmics have the potential to be pro-arrythmic]]
• [[#Recognise the potential for other non-arrythmic adverse effects, as illustrated with amiodarone and digoxin]]

# Notes

## Describe the main classes of anti-arrhythmics (Class 1-4 and unclassified), and their mechanism of action and effect on the cardiac action potential

antiarrhythmic work by 
- blocking ions channels (Na),
- blocking receptors (beta-blockers)

### Class 1. Voltage gated **Sodium channel blockers**
3 sub-classes
- 1a - oldest
- 1b - still used ([[ligocaine]])
- 1c - 'relatively' steady state ([[Flecainide]])
	- Causes lengthening of PR and QRS intervals

### Class 2. Autonomic inhibitors / Antisympathetics (Beta blockers)
### Class 3. Prolong action potential. Potassium channel blockers
### Class 4. Calcium channel blockers

## Recognise that not all anti-arrythmics can be neatly classified (unclassified) such as with digoxin, adenosine and magnesium

## Recognise that antiarrhythmics have the potential to be pro-arrythmic
- it's true
## Recognise the potential for other non-arrythmic adverse effects, as illustrated with amiodarone and digoxin
