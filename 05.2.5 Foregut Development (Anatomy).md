# Overview
how does a simple tube become the gut tube
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts
- GI organization
- zygosis
- mesentries
	- omenta
- lesser omemtum
- lesser sac / omenta bursa
- omental foramen
- Foregut rotation
# Notes

if the tissue is from splanchnopleure, then 
- it gets blood from the unpaired arteries from the anterior side of abdominal arterty
- drains via the portal system (if abdominal)


Unpaired Arteries
- ceoliac
- superior mesenteric
- inferior mesenteric
each have their own ganglion

**Hot Tip**: dorsal mesentry is continuous along the whole gut
ventral mesentry only occurs with foregut (around liver and front of stomach)

Asides
- mesentry goes by many names, e.g. ligament, *the* mesentry

## Foregut rotation
- liver goes rights
	- eventually partially adheres to posterior wall, closing one side of the omenta bursa
- spleen goes left
- ventral pancreas swings around to the right and keeps going around the back until it ends up on the left of the stomach where it meets the dorsal pancreas
- Posterior edge of primitive stomach and its dorsal mesentry => greater curvature and the greater omentum
- Anterior edge of primitive stomach and its anterior mesenetry => lesser curvature and the lesser omentum
- omental foramen becomes the only opening from the space behind the stomach (lesser sac / omental bursa) to the rest of the ab
