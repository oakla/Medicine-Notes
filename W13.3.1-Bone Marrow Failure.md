# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
- Describe clinical manifestations and laboratory features of bone marrow failure
- Develop a basic understanding of the diagnostic approach to bone marrow failure syndromes
- Differentiate between **acute leukaemia**, **myelodysplastic syndrome** and **aplastic anaemia**
## Outline/Sections
Pancytopenia
Polycythaemia Case Study
Acute Leukaemia
- AML
- ALL
## Key Terms & Concepts
### Definitions
- Pancytopenia
- Bicytopenia
- Polcythaemia Vera (Myeloproliferative Neoplasm)

# Notes
## Bone Marrow Failure
- where the bone marrow doesn't create enough blood cells
- if all blood cells are low, we call it 'pancytopenia'
## Pancytopenia
Two broad causes:
- Bone marrow infiltration (space being taken up)
- Bone marrow aplasia
### Bone marrow infiltration causes
- Haematological malignancy, metastatic cancer
### Bone marrow aplasia causes
- Nutritional disorders e.g. vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
- Aplastic anaemia
- Infection e.g. HIV, hepatitis, parvovirus B19
- Immune destruction
- Medication or toxins e.g. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, methotrexate

Acute Leukaemia
- can be lymphoid or myeloid (ALL or AML)

Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) is caused by the malignant transformation of myeloid progenitor cells. Myeloid cell proliferation increases and differentiation decreases. Symptoms are caused by bone marrow failure (lower counts of other blood cells) or increased proliferation.
