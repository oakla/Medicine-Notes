From respiratory block wrap-up lecture


For reference:

Obstructive and restrictive groupings are generalisations and is often a false dichotomy - in reality many patients with COPD have a degree of
pulmonary fibrosis as the disease evolves, and many patients with ILD are also smokers, so mixed forms of lung disease are common.
The confusion arises because thinking about it as "lung destruction" is too simplistic. It's the specific features of the lung damage that lead to the
different patterns of impaired physiology.
"Restrictive disease" is a collection of dozens of distinct diseases. Because of this, any comments about restrictive diseases are also generalisations.
The overall effect on respiration will include the impacts on multiple aspects of normal anatomy and physiology.
Most restrictive diseases have interstitial fibrosis as part of their pathology. Some have focal fibrosis, some are more diffuse. In some the fibrosis is
extensive, and in others it is less so. The general effect of increased fibrous tissue (again, depending on the balance of collagen and elastin, the
distribution, and the amount of fibrous tissue) is that the lung becomes stiffer.
Changing the recoil will change the physiology - stiffer lungs are usually harder to inflate and may also be harder to deflate. So if there is
significant fibrosis, the lungs may in fact recoil faster. However, if lungs are very non-compliant they in fact may be slow to recoil as well. So, in
restrictive conditions you may see overall increased recoil, reduced recoil, or normal recoil depending on the disease. Often however it is reduced,
leading to reduced overall volumes.
The other aspect is gas transfer - in most cases of pulmonary fibrosis there is a reduction in the ability of oxygen to diffuse into the blood in the
affected areas, so depending on how much of the lung is affected, this may impact on diffusion (vs emphysema, where diffusion is often preserved, but
the overall loss of surface area, plus the ability to properly ventilate the distal acini, is affected).
In emphysema the reduction in lung parenchyma tends to also result in a loss of recoil in that part of the lung, but the nature of emphsema means that
the net effect is often not as much as in pulmonary fibrosis (again, a generalisation), however it depends on the degree of damage and the extent to
which the lungs are trying to repair themselves. Bear in mind that the air trapping that can happen in emphysema also affects the degree to which the
lungs are able to recoil.

So in short, changes in compliance can be seen in both patterns, and changes in gas (O2 and CO2) exchange can also be seen. The overall effect
depends on the balance of physiological influences, and the degree in emphysema to which lunch parenchymal damage is balanced by fibrosis, as well
as the various physiological responses. But, as a general rule, there tends to be more loss of compliance in pulmonary fibrosis than in emphysema
(hence the point on the slide).
