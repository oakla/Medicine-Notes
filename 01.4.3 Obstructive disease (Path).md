Obstructive is more important than restrictive
- obstructive is one of the most important


not all diseases fit neatly into the category of obstructive or restrictive

**key presentations**:
- unexplained dyspnoea
- unexplained hypoxaemia
- chronic lung disease

### Key terminology
> • Dyspnoea: Difficult or laboured breathing (‘shortness of breath’); usually a symptom, not a sign
> • Wheeze: high-pitched, polyphonic ‘musical’ sound produced predominantly in expiration by airways of any size (but usually small and medium airways), e.g. asthma (or Darth Vader)
> • Stridor: single pitch (high pitch), upper airway, usually inspiratory, usually laryngeal
> • Stertor: single pitch (low pitch), upper airway (nasal, back of throat), e.g. snoring


Patho Consequences (p9)
obstructive relevance
- lung stiffness -> loss of compliance -> harder to move lungs
- air move in/out
- hyper inflammation
