## AI Defintion
> Today’s consensus name is MASLD (metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease). It requires hepatic steatosis (fat in the liver on imaging/biopsy) plus ≥1 cardiometabolic risk factor (e.g., central obesity, dyslipidaemia, prediabetes/diabetes, hypertension). “MASH” is the inflammatory/fibrosing subtype (formerly NASH). “MetALD” is MASLD with higher alcohol intake. “MAFLD” was an earlier proposal; you’ll still see it in papers, but MASLD is now preferred.
