Modes of action:
- B cell
	- make antibodies
	- Main mechanism of protection for most vaccines
	- Directed against a specific epitope on antigen
	- Neutralise toxins and viruses
	- Block pathogen adhesion / cell entry
	- Direct killing (via complement)
	- Opsonise bacteria for phagocytosis
- T cell
	- Respond to multiple epitopes on antigen
	- Enhance quality of antibody production (T helper)
	- Promote long-lived memory B cells (T helper)
	- Direct killing of infected cells (cytotoxic T cells)

There are memory cells for both B and T cells

Passive immunity
- can come from having lots antibodies from various sources
- 

## Types of Vaccines
- **Inactivated vaccines** – killed micro-organisms, their virulence factors or toxins
- **Live attenuated vaccines** – *attenuated* organisms, developed in cell culture, that replicate in the recipient after administration to induce immune response
- Others including mRNA, viral vectors
