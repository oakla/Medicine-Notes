Notes


## Cardiac Muscle
smaller SR => less Ca stored => more dependent on extracellular Ca
- long plateau phase of AP

## Lipid transport

### Lipoproteins
- Lipoproteins are formed by the binding of apolipoproteins (apoproteins) to lipids
- Lipoprotein complexes carry lipids through circulation
#### Apoproteins
- enzyme cofactors (therefore regulate activity)
	- **apoCII** – required for unloading FAs (LPL-cofactor)
	- apoA1 – required for cholesterol uptake by HDLs
- ligands for cell-surface receptors (destination).
	- **apoB** – required for cellular uptake of LDLs

### Regulation of **cellular** cholesterol
- Inhibit **synthesis**
	- Inhibition of HMG-CoA-reductase activity
- Block **uptake**
	- Reduced LDL-receptor (LDLR) expression
- **Safer storage**
	- stimulates acyl CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT)

## Therapies
- act on synthesis (statin via HMG-CoA-reductase inhibition in the melanovate pathway)
- Increase LDL receptor expression
	- PCSK9 interferes with LDL receptor recycling (causes them to be lysed after use)
		- monoclonal anitbodies can be used as an antagonist to LDL PCSK9
		- Inclisiran: Small interfering RNA
			- supresses PCSK9 production
