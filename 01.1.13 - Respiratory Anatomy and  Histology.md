## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes
it's all about the hyoid
- Upper airway
	- Nose:
		- conchae (plural of concha)
	- Larynx
		- cricoid
		- thyroid
		- respiratory diverticulum (from the gut)
	- Epiglottis
	- Trachea
- Lung anatomy
	- L/R bronchi comparative trajectory
	- primary, lobar (to individual lobes) & segmental (to functional units) bronchi
- Broncho-pulmonary slides

Pulmonary hilum/root/ligament
- root > hilum (within root)
- ?why is a mesentry (sometimes?) a ligament?
- LA is below pulmonary trunk => ateries from hilum are above veins of hilum
- **aterial aspect is always closer to the air pipe(s)**
L/R differences
- impressions



- Hilar nodes look like black beans
	- they are lymph nodes. therefore take up carbon

- Pleural innervation
