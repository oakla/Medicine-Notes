- Somite in cross transverse section looks like an ice-cream cone (at least in diagrams)
	- the cone is the [[sclerotome]], and is deep
	- the 'ice-cream' bit is the fusion of dermatome and myotome (dermamyotome), and is superficial relative to the sclerotome

Somites are blocks of **paraxial mesodermal tissue**. They can be divided into 3 components  

1. [[sclerotome]] => _only_ vertabrae and ribs
2. Dermatome 
3. Myotome => body wall & limb muscles

the second two (dermatomes and mytomes) fuse to become dermamyotomes. These split into dorsal and ventral components; epimere (dorsal) and hypomere (ventral)

  

The myotome component of epimere becomes intrinsic back muscles and are all supplied by the dorsal rami of mixed spinal nerves. The dermatome component becomes dermis covering those muscles.   

  

The myotome component of hypomere becomes the entire body wall & ALL limb muscles (includes extrinsic back muscles (more superficial: Traps, lats etc)) and are all supplied by the ventral rami of mixed spinal nerves. The dermatome component disintegrates and becomes nothing. Dermis of body wall & limbs from somatopleure
