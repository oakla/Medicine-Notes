# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
- Develop basic understanding of mechanism of action and side effects of commonly used Immunosuppressive drugs
- List the most common indications for immunomodulatory therapies
- Understand the structure and function of B cell depleting (CD20) monoclonal antibodies
- Describe the mechanism of action for the two commonly used checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 and CTLA- 4)
- Describe the various mechanisms of action for IVIg therapy

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts
- Corticosteroids

# Notes
Types
- Classical “small molecule” Drugs
- Monoclonal antibodies or “Biologics”
- Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIg)
- Plasmapheresis

Small Molecules
- Corticosteroids e.g. Prednisilone, dexamethasone
	- too unspecific => many side-effects
- Anti-metabolites e.g. Azathioprine, mycophenolate (MMF)
- Calcineurin inhibitors e.g. cyclosporin, tacrolimus

Monoclonal antibodies or “Biologics”
- Monoclonal antibodies that deplete specific cells of the immune system
	- **B cell depleting (CD20) monoclonal antibodies**
		- treats B cell lymphoma
		- Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity
		- targets CD20 which is not present (and therefore does not target) parts of B cell life cycle
			- stem cells 
			- plasma cells
- Monoclonal antibodies or synthetic proteins that impair the function of immune cells or their products (eg. cytokines)
- Monoclonal antibodies that increase T cell activation (anti-cancer therapy)
	- Immune checkpoint inhibitor (see [[W10.4.2-Tumour immunology]])

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy
- antibodies from other people given to patients with antibody deficiency disorders

Plasmapheresis
