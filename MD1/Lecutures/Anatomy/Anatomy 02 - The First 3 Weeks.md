## Overview
### Learning Outcomes
- Use the correct (quadrupedal) directional terms for describing structures relative to others in the embryo
- Describe the developmental processes that take place in weeks 1-3, as demonstrated in this lecture
- Be able to identify and describe the anatomy of the early embryo & its primordia
- Describe the 5 embryonic mechanisms used, and understand the principles behind Von Baerâ€™s laws of embryology

### Outline
- Week 1
	- Cleavage/Hatching
	- Implantation
- Week 2
	- Forming bilaminar embryo
	- Formation of first cavities
	- Embryonic mechanisms
- Week 3
	- Gastrulation
	- Neurulation
### Goal
The path from 2 haploid cells to an "implanted embryo"

### Sections
- 
- Cleavage & Hatching

## Notes
- The basic body plan of *any* vertebrate is 'a tube within a tube'. The outer tube is made of [[ectoderm]] and the inner tube is made of [[endoderm]].

### Week  1
#### Cleavage & Hatching
Starting from one cell incarcerated in the [[zona pellucida]], cells proliferate to become a [[morula]] which then 'takes a drink' to develop a [[blastocoel]], thus becoming a [[blastocyst]]. This blastocyst escapes from the ZP (ideally) inside the uterus when it becomes implanted into the [[endometrium]].

#### Implantation
Trophoblast embeds into the endometrium. Syncytiotrophoblast look for nutrients. Cytotrophoblast holds the inner cell mass (ICM) and the blastocoel

### Week 2
#### Fully Implanted Embryo
More things appear
- Primitive germ layers appear: **epiblast** and **hypoblast** from the ICM. (Hypoblast is extraembryonic)
- **Heuser's membrane** appears (is not hypoblast) surrounding the **yolk sac**
- EEM. Facilitates formation of the chorionic cavity
### Week 2: Bilaminar embryo
Chrorion continues to expand
Primary yolk sac moves to the ventral side and leaves part behind referred to as the '[[definitive yolk sac]]'

### Blood Supply

### Week 3: Gastrulation
Gastrulation is the formation of the 3 embryonic cells layers

### Embryonic disk
- within the primitive node is primitive pit
- "important to quote the correct part of the primitive streak depending on what you're talking about"

### Embryonic Mechanisms
1. Proliferate
2. Differentiate
3. Migration
4. Induction
5. Combination
