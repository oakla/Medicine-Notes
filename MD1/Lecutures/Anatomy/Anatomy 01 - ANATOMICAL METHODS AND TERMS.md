## Lecture Overview
- Advice on how to approach learning in this topic
- Understand that the evolutionary and embryonic history of an organism provide insight and context into the adult structure and function
- Anatomical terms for orientation, direction and position

## How to Study


## Misc Notes
The [[Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve]] (RLN) is a good example of why studying anatomy via embryonic development is a good idea. The RLN is a nerve that is unusual in that it does a large detour under the aorta only to travel back up to the neck. This makes much more sense if you understand the developmental timeline that leads to this.


## Anatomical Position and Terms
### General Directional Terms

### Absolute Reference Terms

### Bipeds (Adults) vs Quadrupeds (Embryo/Fetal/ <12 months old)
