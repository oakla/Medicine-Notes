## Overview 
### Learning Outcomes

### Outline

- 5 types
- diagnostic microbiology
- microscopy
	- bacteria
	- mycobacteria and fungi 
- culture
	- media types

## Notes

types:
- bacteria
- fungi
- parasites
- viruses
- prions

diagnosis
- chest x-ray is a physical examination - *not* a laboratory test
- sample considerations: volume, freshness
- tools: sterile container, swabs (black ('transport medium' (stabilizes sample)) and white), flocked swab, blood sample in EDTA tube, blood sample in SST tube (clot activator), blood cultures (detects bacteria metabolism via CO<sub>2</sub>)

### Microscopy
- [[peptidogylcan]]
Bacteria
- gram-stains:
	- can be classified into 2 broad categories; gram-positive and gram-negative
	- peptidoglycan present in cell wall. 
	- gram stain shows cell walls with thick peptidoglycan layer
-  cell morphology and intercell arrangement

Fungi (and mycobacteria)
- ZN stain under heat
### Culture
Media
- non-selective
- selective
- differential

Rapid benchtop tests

Susceptibility testing

Nucleic acid amplification test (PCR)
- grow DNA/RNA

[[Serology]]
- [[antigen]] detection (e.g. covid RAT)
- [[antibody]] detection - send serology to lab
	- lots of false pos esp IgM
	- IgG only tells you if you had the thing at some point in the past (not necessarily now)

Further Characterisation
- [[Serotyping]] - look for specific surface antigens
- [[Sequencing]]
