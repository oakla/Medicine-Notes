Neurotransmitter
- Production
- Release



### Revision Exercises
- In the CNS, what are the:
	- Main excitatory neurotransmitter?
		- CNS 
		- PNS (trick question)
	- Main inhibitory transmitter?
		- CNS
		- PNS (trick question)
- What are most neurotransmitters derived from?
	- Bonus: Why? (i.e. what advantage does this offer) - Simplicity/Recyclability 
	- Bonus: Example (Tyrosine -> (Dopamine, Adrenaline/Epinephrine))
- How are most neurotransmitters released? - Exocytosis triggered by an AP
	- What blocks vesicles from being released?
		- Snares
		- Snares (v & t) initially blocked by complexin
	- What unblocks them?
		- Ca binds to synaptotagmin -> forms complex which displaces complexin
		- 
- How to stop?
	- SSRIs
	- enzymes
