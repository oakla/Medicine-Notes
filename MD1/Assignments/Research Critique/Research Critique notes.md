Randomization by minimization: 
- "Concerns over the use of minimization have centered on the fact that treatment assignments may be predicted with certainty in some situations and on the implications for the analysis methods used."


Summary of objectives, findings, and contribution to literature:

isolate the degree to which parent-child interactions influence ADHD symptoms and child behavioural problems

Does psychoeducation (1) improve ADHD symptoms, and (2) does it also improvement other, more general, cognitive and behavioural problems, and improve 

effects were measured via parents, teachers, and clinicians
- parents: improvement in core symptoms and some sub-domains
- teachers: no improvement
- clinicians: improvement in clinical functioning

| Observer | ADHD Core Symptoms | inattention/ cognition | hyperactivity/ impulsivity | oppositional |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ |
| Parent   | yes                | yes                    | yes                        | no           |
| Teacher  | no                 | n/a                    | n/a                        | n/a          |
Impact on families

### Weirdness
Both previous and current study showed improvements in ADHD core symptoms
Previous study 
- showed improvements in "conduct problems"
- did **not** show improvements in "quality of life and parental well-being"

Contribution to literature:
- does the therapy improve ADHD symptoms by addressing parenting issues ("promoting positive parenting techniques and reducing negative parenting factors in the families") rather reducing ADHD core symptoms themselves
