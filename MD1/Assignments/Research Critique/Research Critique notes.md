Randomization by minimization: 
- "Concerns over the use of minimization have centered on the fact that treatment assignments may be predicted with certainty in some situations and on the implications for the analysis methods used."


Summary of objectives, findings, and contribution to literature:



Does psychoeducation (1) improve ADHD symptoms, and (2) does it also improve other, more general, cognitive and behavioural problems in the child, parent-child interactions, and parenting stress levels.
#### Differences to previous study:
- work to establish external validity of this psychoeducation program by testing in a previously untested population (UK population)
- uses a 'treatment as usual' control (rather than an active control)
- previous study 
	- could 
		- observe improvement in "pro social" aspects (domain of SDQ)
	- could not
		- No significant differences in quality of life or family stress were found

effects were measured via parents, teachers, and clinicians
- parents: improvement in core symptoms and some sub-domains
- teachers: no improvement
- clinicians: improvement in clinical functioning

emotional symptoms
conduct problems
hyperactivity
problems with peers
pro-social

| Observer | ADHD Core Symptoms | inattention/ cognition | hyperactivity/ impulsivity | oppositional |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ |
| Parent   | yes                | yes                    | yes                        | no           |
| Teacher  | no                 | n/a                    | n/a                        | n/a          |
Impact on families

### Weirdness
Both previous and current study showed improvements in ADHD core symptoms
Previous study 
- showed improvements in "conduct problems"
- did **not** show improvements in "quality of life and parental well-being"
#### Concepts they talk about or raise (inferring they want to investigate)
- negative parenting factors influence on ADHD symptoms
	- does the therapy improve ADHD symptoms by addressing parenting issues ("promoting positive parenting techniques and reducing negative parenting factors in the families") rather reducing ADHD core symptoms themselves
	- seems like they want to isolate the degree to which parent-child interactions influence ADHD symptoms and child behavioural problems (but they never do)
- identifying "what works for whom" (but they never address or answer this question)

### Measures used:

#### Connors Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form (CPRS-R:S)
- Conners, C. K. (1989). Connersâ€™ Rating Scales Manual. New York, NY: Multi Health Systems

#### Children's Global Assessment Scale
- [A children's global assessment scale (CGAS) - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6639293/)
- "recommended ... as a complement to syndrome-specific scales"

#### Clinical Global Impression Scale
CGI-I and CGI-S subscales exist (I and S stand for improvement and severity respectively)
