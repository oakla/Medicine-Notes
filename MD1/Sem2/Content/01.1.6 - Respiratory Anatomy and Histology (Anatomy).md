# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes
it's all about the hyoid
- Upper airway
	- Nose:
		- conchae (plural of concha)
	- Larynx
		- cricoid
		- thyroid
		- respiratory diverticulum (from the gut)
	- Epiglottis
	- Trachea
- Lung anatomy
	- L/R bronchi comparative trajectory
	- primary, lobar (to individual lobes) & segmental (to functional units) bronchi
- Broncho-pulmonary slides

Pulmonary hilum/root/ligament
- root > hilum (within root)
- ?why is a mesentry (sometimes?) a ligament?
- LA is below pulmonary trunk => ateries from hilum are above veins of hilum
- **aterial aspect is always closer to the air pipe(s)**
L/R differences (slide 11)
- impressions
- n lobes
	- right - 2 cuts, 3 lobes
	- left - 1 cut, 2 lobes
	- can't always see the fissures
	- lobe ID
		- Right
			- lingular below cardiac notch
			- LV impression
		- Left
			- RA impression
	- Other impressions
		- BVs
			- most brachiocephalic (except no BC artery on left lung)
			- Left - aortic arch impression instead of BC artery
			- Azygos - impression on right lung (often mistake for tiny aorta)
		- oesophogeal impression smaller on left lung because of aorta
		- aorta impression on posterior half of left lung (helps orientate)
- Bronchopulmonary Segments (BPS) s13-14
	- **functional unit** (???)
		> "Functional unit: Tertiary bronchus & arterial branch
			- Includes surrounding CT & bound within independent septa"
		- **septa of the lungs**\
		- CT elements supplied by **bronchial arteries**
	- segments (???)
		- make up functional units?
	- 10 BPS (left might only have 9)
- lymphatic basics (s15)
	- generally flow periphery to hilum
	- Hilar nodes look like black beans
		- they are lymph nodes. therefore take up carbon
- Lung Innervation (s16)
	- how does it get there
	- involves vagus and sympathetic chain ganglia
	- vasoconstrictions increases gas exchange time per RBC
	- bronchodilation via endocrine (not nervous => stress response does not cause dilation)
- Pleural Innervation (s17)
	- what can we feel? why?
	- phrenic is different?

- Pleural innervation
