**Obstructive is more important than restrictive**
- obstructive is one of the most important


not all diseases fit neatly into the category of obstructive or restrictive

**key presentations**:
- unexplained dyspnoea
- unexplained hypoxaemia
- chronic lung disease

### Key terminology
> • Dyspnoea: Difficult or laboured breathing (‘shortness of breath’); usually a symptom, not a sign
> • Wheeze: high-pitched, polyphonic ‘musical’ sound produced predominantly in expiration by airways of any size (but usually small and medium airways), e.g. asthma (or Darth Vader)
> • Stridor: single pitch (high pitch), upper airway, usually inspiratory, usually laryngeal
> • Stertor: single pitch (low pitch), upper airway (nasal, back of throat), e.g. snoring


Patho Consequences (p9)
**relevant to obstructive disease**
- lung stiffness -> loss of compliance -> harder to move lungs
- air move in/out
- hyper inflammation

parenchymal - "the solid bit of the organ"
- issue in most restrictive disease

some obstructive diseases don't have an obvious obstruction

am alveolus is like a baloon

p12
obstricive vs restrictive matters because it assists diagnosis and management


p13
- obstructive 
	- mostly *increases* lung volume because air is more difficult ot get out
		- increase in residual volume
	- FEV1 reduced
- restrictive
	- TLC down
	- RV down
	- harder to get air in

p17
- Common obstructive
	- COPD (Emphysema and Chronic Bronchitis)
	- Asthma
	- Bronchiectasis
	- Chronic Broncholitis

p19 - important/useful table


p22
- overlap is almost total - because of smoking

p23
- emphasema cause chronic bronchitis
- smoking causes both
- think of them seperately

## Conditions
### Asthma
p25,26 - types of asthma
type 1 sensitivity
1. atopic
2. drug induced(e.g. aspirin)
3. occupational
4. intrinsic

- severe 

p28 - pathogenesis

### Emphysema
p34 Emphysema - Pathogenesis
- **alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency**

clinical
x-ray
- less whiteness => more air => less tissue 
- barrel chest
pathology
- hyper inflation
- **bullae** - rupture -> spontaneous pneumothrorax
- big holes -> emphysema (also pumopnary fibrosis but with fibrous outlines)
- "relentlessly progressively"

p38 - 2 major/most important types of emphysema
- differ in where they originate from

### Chronic Bronchitis
- chronic bronchitis is a *clinical* diagnosis not a pathological one
- chron bronchitis & emphysema => COPD

## Bronchiectasis
- patient usually has other problems
