---
## 3. Key Definitions / Terms
* **Agenesis**:
	* Doesn't grow (absence of one or both kidneys)
* **Oligohydramnios**:
	* lack of amniotic fluid in development
* **Vesicoureteric reflux**:
	* malformed bladder (uteric) valve => utreter back pressure => disstended ureter
* **Hydronephrosis**:

* Urolithiasis complications: obstruction, haematuria, infection, renal failure.
---

* Potter‚Äôs syndrome (bilateral agenesis).
* Horseshoe kidney (fusion + IMA entrapment).
* ADPKD (adult, liver cysts, berry aneurysms).
* ARPKD (childhood, liver fibrosis, portal HTN).
* Struvite stone (staghorn calculus from Proteus/Klebsiella).
* Classic renal colic presentation.
---
## 10. Summary (1‚Äì2 sentences)
* Write your own short version:
  *‚ÄúThis lecture taught me that‚Ä¶‚Äù*
---
## 11. Personal Memory Hooks
* Sketch a horseshoe shape with IMA trapping.
* Mnemonic for stone types (e.g. **CUSS** ‚Üí Calcium, Uric acid, Struvite, Cystine).
* Potter‚Äôs = ‚ÄúPotter‚Äôs baby can‚Äôt pee ‚Üí no amniotic fluid ‚Üí hypoplastic lungs.‚Äù
* ADPKD = ‚Äúadult, aneurysms, associated cysts.‚Äù
* ARPKD = ‚Äúrecessive, radial cysts, liver fibrosis.‚Äù

# üßæ Lecture Summary: Urolithiasis, Obstruction & Congenital Malformations
## üéØ Learning Objectives
* Recognize **major congenital anomalies** of kidney/urinary tract & their complications.
* Outline **cystic renal diseases**: causes, pathogenesis, clinical features.
* Classify **urinary tract obstruction**: causes, features, complications.
* Explain how obstruction ‚Üí **kidney injury**.
---
## üë∂ Congenital Malformations
* \~10% of people born with significant anomaly.
* 20% of childhood renal failure due to dysplasia/hypoplasia.
* 10% of chronic renal failure due to ADPKD.

**Types:**
* Agenesis (uni/bilateral)
* Hypoplasia
* Ectopic kidney
* Horseshoe kidney
* Duplex collecting system
* Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR)
* Posterior urethral valves

**Key Examples:**
* **Bilateral agenesis (Potter‚Äôs syndrome):** oligohydramnios, hypoplastic lungs, fatal.
* **Unilateral agenesis:** often silent; contralateral hypertrophy.
* **Ectopic kidney:** pelvic, tortuous ureter ‚Üí obstruction/infection.
* **Horseshoe kidney:** fusion across midline; trapped at IMA; ‚Üë infections, stones, cancer.
* **VUR:** faulty ureterovesical junction ‚Üí reflux, scarring.
* **Posterior urethral valves (males):** obstructive membrane ‚Üí neonatal obstruction, oligohydramnios, infections.
* **ADPKD** and **ARPKD** - types of congenital cystic renal diseases
* Multicystic renal dysplasia

## ü´ß Cystic Renal Disease
**Spectrum:**
* Simple renal cysts (common >50y, usually benign).
* Cystic renal dysplasia (multicystic dysplastic kidney): irregular cysts, abnormal tissue; mass in infants.
* Polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD, ARPKD).
* Medullary diseases (e.g. nephronophthisis, sponge kidney).
* Syndromic cysts (e.g. tuberous sclerosis).
* Cystic renal neoplasms

**Clues to Malignacy in cystic renal lesions**
- Multiple septa
- Thickened cyst wall

  * Gene: PKHD1 ‚Üí fibrocystin.
  * Smooth kidneys, radially oriented cysts (dilated collecting ducts).
  * Associated: liver cysts, fibrosis, portal HTN.
