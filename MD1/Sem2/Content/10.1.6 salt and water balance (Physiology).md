# üìù Renal Physiology ‚Äì Salt & Water Balance (Proforma)

## Lecture Outcomes

* Water balance (    )
* Na‚Å∫ balance (    )
* K‚Å∫ balance (    )

---

## Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)

water osmolarity in renal tubules: 50-1200 mOsmoles

reduces water loss through kidneys: increases water reabsorption (DCT/CT/CD)
- (Does other things too)

* **Stimulus for release:**    Osmolarity of Na (dominant driver)      
* **Site of synthesis:**    supraoptic (5/6th) and paraventricular (1/6th) nuclei          
* **Site of release:**      posterior pituitary      
* **Mechanism of action on nephron:**     triggers exocytosis of aquaporins onto cells surface     
* **Aquaporins involved:**         AQP-2 aquaporins on *apical* surface   
* **Effect on plasma osmolarity & urine concentration:**  
	* plasma osmolarity down
	* urine concentration up

## Renin‚ÄìAngiotensin‚ÄìAldosterone System (RAAS)
- retains Na
- does not change plasma osmolarity because ADH dominates
- Angiotensin is converted in the lungs by Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) into Angiotensin II (AtII)
- AtII stimulates release of Aldosterone from the adrenal cortex
### Renin
* **Secreted by:**   granula cells in the JGA        
* **Stimuli for secretion:**     \[NaCl\] in DCT - detected by macula densa of the JGA

### Angiotensin II (AtII)
- short half-life
* **Direct effects on nephron:**            
	* Na reabsorption - MOSTLY first half (PCT)
	* increase Na-K pump
	* increase Na/H exchange *if it can*
* **Other effects (systemic):**           
	* stims aldosterone secretion

### Aldosterone
- steroid hormone => longer half (hours)
* **Secreted by:**         andrenal cortex       
* **Main stimuli:**           Angio-II     
* **Cellular mechanism:**              
	* increase NaK ATPase
	* increases permeability of Na and increase Na transporters
* **Effects on Na‚Å∫, K‚Å∫, H‚Å∫:**     
	* increases Na absorption in later parts of tubule (cortical CT)      
	* to get Na, K and H is exchanged into lumen
	* lowers K and H levels because no chance to resorb after pumping out

---

## Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)
the counter to RAAS
* **Stimulus for release:**          
	* stretch on atria   
* **Effects on kidney:**             
	* switches off things that Ald swithced on - switches off Na reabsorption
* **Effects on BP/volume:**    
	* Decrease

---

## Potassium Balance

* **Normal plasma \[K‚Å∫]:**           
	* low but very tightly controlled
* **Site of regulated K‚Å∫ secretion in nephron:** 
	* late DCT/CT
* **Determinants of secretion rate:**        
	* mostly NaK pump
	* also permeability and EC gradient
* **Aldosterone role in K‚Å∫ balance:**    
	* reduces K reabsorption because it acts on the later half of the renal tubule

Dead or damage cells can release abnormal amount of K

---

## Thirst Mechanism

* **Stimuli for thirst:**              
	* increase in Osmo (main)
	* angiotensin - is also an NT that triggers other receptors that trigger thirst 
* **Hypothalamic centres involved:**        
	* Hypothalamic anteroventral-3rd-ventricle (AV3V) region
* **Integration with ADH release:**    
	* AV3V neurons lie outside BBB, & use AtII as a neurotransmitter ‚Üí AtII potentiates thirst

AV3V projects to supraoptic & paraventricular nuclei (where ADH synthesis happens)

---

## Salt Appetite

* **Stimuli:**    
	* decrease plasma Na conc
	* low BP/vol (also stims thirst)
	* AtII
* **Shared regulation with thirst:**      
	* low BP
	* AtII

---

## Integration & Summary

* **Interactions between ADH, AtII, Aldosterone, ANP:**    
* **How these systems regulate BP and volume together:**
