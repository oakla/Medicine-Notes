## Lung Volumes p5 
- tidal volume at goldolocks zone
	- 0.5L (500ml) ~3 - 3.5L
	- easy effort breathing here

- p6 resistance
	- elastic
	- non-elastic
		- airflow
			- tube size dependent
		- viscous
- p8
	- lung 0 pressure volume is 0%
	- chest wall 0 pressure volume is ~70%
	- together they an equilibrium of ~around ~50%
- p10
	- >80% spring inwards
	- <80% spring outwards
- p11
	- surface tension problems at small volumes
	- surfacant reduces this - premie babies have difficulty (IRDS)
	- produced by type II surfacants
- Hysteresis - more work to breath in 
- Compliance
	- problems of low
	- problems of high
- p18 Airway resistance is pipe size, and turbulence

- control of resistance
	- mucous
		- optimum amount
	- constriction 
		- PSNS 
		- histamine H1
	- dilation 
		- endocrine adnrenaline
- Reflex
	- constriction (up ACh)
		- dust
		- temperature
		- alveolar hypocapnia
	- dilation (down ACh)
- Bronchodilaiton
	- b2-adernergic
- Pulmonary function tests
	- key numbers
		- PEF
		- FEV_1
		- FEV_1/FVC
		- F-V loops
- restrictive -> reduced lung capacity
	- e.g. 
		- remove a lung
		- late stage pregnancy
- obstructive -> increased resistance

- FEV_1 diagnoses **obstructive**
