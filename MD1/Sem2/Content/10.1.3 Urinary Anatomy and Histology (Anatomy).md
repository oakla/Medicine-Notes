## 🩺Anatomy 2 - Urinary Anatomy & Histology – Key Structures

---

### 🟦 Kidney – Gross Anatomy
- **Renal segments** (defined by segmental arteries, no anastomosis → clinical: infarction risk)
- **Renal lobes** (~7; cortex + medullary pyramid)
- **Cortex**  
  - Glomeruli  
  - Proximal & distal convoluted tubules  
  - Shallow loops of Henle  
  - Medullary rays
- **Medulla**  
  - Pyramids: long loops of Henle, collecting ducts, papilla
- **Drainage pathway**: Papilla → Minor calyx → Major calyx → Renal pelvis → Ureter
- **Renal arterial system**: Renal a. → Segmental → Interlobar → Arcuate → Interlobular (radiate) → Afferent arteriole
- **Nerve supply**  
  - Sympathetic: T9–L1 (↓ GFR, ↑ renin)  
  - Parasympathetic: Vagus (possible opposite effects)

### 🟨 Nephron & Histology
- **Nephron components** (≈1 million/kidney)  
  1. Bowman’s capsule  
  2. Glomerulus (together = renal corpuscle)  
  3. Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)  
  4. Loop of Henle (thick & thin segments)  
  5. Distal convoluted tubule (DCT)  
  6. Collecting ducts
- **Glomerulus anatomy**  
  - Afferent & efferent arterioles  
  - Juxtaglomerular apparatus:  
    - Mesangial cells (debris clearance)  
    - JG cells (renin release)  
    - Macula densa (Na⁺/Cl⁻ sensing)  
  - Podocytes → pedicels → slit diaphragms  
  - Basement membrane barrier
- **Cortical vs. juxtamedullary nephrons**  
  - Cortical (~80–90%): short LoH, peritubular capillaries  
  - Juxtamedullary (~10–20%): long LoH, vasa recta → countercurrent multiplication

### 🟥 Ureter
- **Course**  
  1. Narrowing at pelvi-ureteric junction  
  2. Crossing iliac vessels (pelvic brim)  
  3. Intramural bladder wall
- **Blood supply**  
  - Upper ureter: renal artery branches  
  - Lower ureter: vesicular branches of internal iliac
- **Nerve supply**  
  - Sympathetic: T9–L2 (↓ peristalsis, ↑ tone)  
  - Parasympathetic: vagus (upper), pelvic splanchnics S2–S4 (lower, ↑ peristalsis)

### 🟩 Bladder
- **Shape**: triangular pyramid (4 surfaces, 4 points)  
  - **Trigone** (posterior, receives ureters)  
  - **Apex** → urachus (median umbilical ligament)  
  - **Neck** → urethral exit (internal sphincter)  
- **Muscle**: detrusor (3 layers)  
  - Inner longitudinal  
  - Middle circular  
  - Outer longitudinal
- **Histology**  
  - Transitional epithelium (urothelium)  
  - Thick muscularis externa  
  - Adventitia (retroperitoneal)


### Tom's Summary
 - The segments of a kidney are defined by the segmental arteries, which do not anastomose with each other, meaning that infarction to one of them can cause the entire segment to become necrotic.
- The cortex and medulla of a kidney contain different aspects of a nephron, which is why they look so different. There are parts of the cortex that encroach on medullary territory, and parts of the medulla that encroach into cortical territory.
- The glomerulus is a specialised filter that joins the blood component to the urinary excretion component, where specialised cells, structures, spaces allows for a highly selective barrier, which each part playing a slightly different role.
- Not all nephrons have equal function, which is in part due to the differences in the length of the LoH, but also in how the efferent arteriole system interacts with that loop.
- The histological appearance of different tubules can be matched to its functional demand, because of the structural requirement related to holding organelles for said function (e.g. microvilli for increased surface area for reabsorption)
- The kidneys and ureters are primary retroperitoneal, which means they pass behind most other visceral related structures. The blood supply and nerve supply of the ureter is tricky because of the migratory nature of their development. Meaning the more cranial aspects relate to progressively more cranial arteries spinal nerve levels, which is why ureteric stone pain moves down the body wall dermatomes. It can also be said that the kidney end has the same supply as the kidney and the bladder end has the same supply as the bladder.
- The development of the ureter being from the dorsal aspect of the mesonephric tube also describes the morphology of how it enters the bladder, and why the ureterovesical junction does not require a sphincter/valve. The intramural aspect of the ureter performs that function, because part of the ureter is dragged through the length of the bladder wall during development.
