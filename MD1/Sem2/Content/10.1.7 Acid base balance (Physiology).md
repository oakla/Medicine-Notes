## Kidney Physiology 4 - Acid–Base Balance
### Lecture Outcomes

* What are the three main regulatory systems for acid–base balance?

1.
2.
3.

* What are the consequences of acid–base disorders?
* What skills should I develop from this lecture?

---

### Acid–Base Homeostasis

* **Normal ECF \[H+]**: 0.000004 (not important)
* **Normal arterial pH**: 7.4
- CO2 is 'lewis acid'
### Normal Values

* **Define**:
  * **Acidosis** (process)/ **Acidaemia** (state): Art pH < 7.35
  * **Alkalosis** (process)/ **Alkalaemia** (state): art pH > 7.45

* **Fill in typical pH values**:
  * **Arterial blood**: 7.4
  * **Venous blood/ Interstitial Fluid**: 7.35 (ISF carries the CO2 that makes venous blood more acidic)
  * **ICF**: 7.35 (because 
  * **Urine**: 7.35
  * **Gastric HCl**: 0.8

### pH Effects

* **On metabolism**: reduces enzyme activity
* **On neuromuscular system**:
	* **pH affects Plasma Ca²⁺-albumin binding**:
  * Acidosis → inhibitory
	  * increases free Ca => blocks Na voltage gated channels => muscle inhibition
	  * increases => plasma K conc
  * Alkalosis → excitatory
	* opposite of above
	* also makes muscles weaker because of 
* **K⁺ balance changes**:

---

### Clinical Consequences

* **List systemic effects of *acidaemia* (CV, metabolic, neuro, resp)**:
	* hyperventilation
	* cerebral dysfunction => coma
	* headaches
* **List systemic effects of *alkalaemia* (CV, metabolic, neuro, resp)**:
	* muscular weakness (from over activation), tetanus, pain, tremors
	* hypoventilation

---

### Daily Acid Load

* **Fixed acid produced per kg/day**:
* **Main sources of acid**:
	* food
	* bicarbonate production (e.g. pancreas)

---

### Defense Mechanisms

* **Buffering** (speed, capacity, key systems):
	* e.g. bicarb in blood
	* bones
* **Pulmonary regulation**:
	* PCO2
* **Renal regulation**:

pKa of a buffer acid determines the optimal pH for effectiveness of that buffer
bicarbonate's pKa (6.37) is not where we want it (7.4) => so we compensate by using lots of it

---

### Buffer Systems

* **Main ECF buffer**: bicarb
* **Main ICF buffer**: phospahte
* Proteins also used
* **Henderson–Hasselbalch equation**:

---

### Respiratory Control
"very effective"
* **Hyperventilation effect**: alkilosis
* **Hypoventilation effect**: acidosis
* **Approximate pH change if VA doubles**:
	* 0.23 (7.4 → 7.63) - well into alkilosis
* **Approximate pH change if VA drops to ¼**:
	* 0.45 (7.4 → 6.95) - well into acidosis

---

### Renal Control

* **How are HCO₃⁻ and H⁺ handled**?
	* bicarb in filtrate by default
	* no bicarb transporter to reabsorb on *apical* side
	* instead 
		* H ions are pumped into lumen
		* carbonic anhydrase in lumen converts H and bicarb to CO2
		* **CO2** is reabsorbed
	* overall pH adjustment is determined by amount of H secreted
		* if alkolosis => pump no H
		* if acidosis => pump lots of H
* **Mechanisms of H⁺ secretion in nephron segments**:
	* In early part (PCT, TAL, early DCT) where there's lots of bicarb: 
		1. Basal NaK-pump => Na into interstitium. Creates **secondary active transport drive**
		2. Apical Na-Proton exchanger (Na in, H out). Secondary active transport driven by step 1
	- In late part
		1. CO2 from interstial fluid. Generates H in lumen cells 
		2. H pumped into lumen and electro balanced with Cl
	- H (as ammonium) can also can be generated from glutamate (less important)
* **Link between K⁺ imbalance and alkalosis**:
	* K and H move in opposite directions (electroneutrality)
	* alkalosis causes high K loss (hypokalaemia)
	* to a lesser extent, alkalosis cause K to shift into ICF from plasma

### Acid–Base Disorders

* **How to determine *metabolic vs respiratory***?
	* aterial blood analysis:
		* high PCO2 => resp
		* high bicarb => metabolic
* **Primary variable altered in**:

  * **Metabolic disorders**:
  * **Respiratory disorders**:
* **Compensation**:

  * **Respiratory acidosis**:
	  * decreased pH, increased CO2
  * **Respiratory alkalosis**:
  * **Metabolic acidosis**:
  * **Metabolic alkalosis**:

---

### Anion Gap
- 
- distinguishes two types of meta acidosis
- increase A gap => exogenous or endogenous **H source** (or poison)
	- e.g. ketoacidosis, drugs
- normal A gap =>
	- loss of bicarb in diahorrea, carbonic anhydrase-inhibitors

### Summary Notes

* **Key take-home points from this lecture**:
	* Acid-base balance is regulated by buffers, ventilation and kidneys
	* acid-base disorders can be metabolic or respiratory
	* metabolic disorders create respiratory compensation
	* repsiratory disorders create metabolic compensation
