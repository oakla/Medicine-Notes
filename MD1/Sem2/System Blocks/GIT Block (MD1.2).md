## Body Sites
- mouth
- [[Stomach]]

## What to know

### Hinted or Explicitly State by Lecturer
- GIT Tumours - main sites and type[^3]
- 
## Random thoughts (to file somewhere later)
- upper oesophagus and anus have similarities not shared with rest of gut tube
	- stratified squamous epithelium
	- skeletal muscle

 - polyps - growth from mucosa into lumen
	 - benign - adenoma
	 - malignant - adenocarcinoma
### Overview stuff
Tissue and cell types of the GIT[^1]
- Epithelium (specialised in different areas; protective, secretory, absorption; with mesothelium around the peritonealised component)
- Smooth muscle (muscularis mucosae, muscularis propria)
- Nerves and ganglia (submucosal and myenteric plexus)
- Neuroendocrine / enterochromaffin cells
- Blood vessels (veins, arteries, lymphatics)
- Immune tissue (MALT, lymph nodes, lymphatics)
- Connective tissue (fat, fibrous tissue, skeletal muscle)

### System Organisation
- **Upper Aerodigestive tract**
	- Includes mouth and mucosal membranes, tongue, teeth, jaw and supporting structures. 
	- Nasopharynx, oropharynx
	- Nasal cavity, nasal sinuses, larynx
	- Salivary glands
## Anatomy
- [[pancreas]]
- [[Liver]]

### Nerves

| Structure   |       |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Hard palate | CN.V2 |
| Soft palate | CN.V2 |

## Pathology

- Peritonitis

### Conditions
