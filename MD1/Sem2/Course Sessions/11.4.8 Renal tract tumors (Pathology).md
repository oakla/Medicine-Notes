# 🩺 Tumours of the Bladder and Kidneys – Summary Notes

## Kidney Tumours

### Types

- **Benign**: renal papillary adenoma, angiomyolipoma, oncocytoma
    
- **Malignant**:
    
    - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) – most common (~75%)
        
    - Papillary RCC
        
    - Chromophobe RCC
        
    - Others (≥10 subtypes)
        

### Epidemiology & Risk Factors

- 50% more common in men
    
- Peak age: 50–70 years
    
- Risks: smoking, obesity, hypertension, toxins (cadmium, asbestos, petroleum), genetic syndromes (e.g., Von Hippel-Lindau)
    

### Pathogenesis

- **Clear cell RCC** arises from proximal tubule epithelium
    
- **VHL gene loss (chr 3p):**  
    → ↑ IGF-1 → ↑ HIF → ↑ VEGF → angiogenesis & tumour growth
    

### Clinical Features

- Often **silent**, found incidentally on imaging (>50%)
    
- Classic triad (late stage):
    
    1. Haematuria
        
    2. Flank pain
        
    3. Abdominal mass
        
- Other: weight loss, fever, scrotal varices (esp. left side), paraneoplastic syndromes (↑EPO → erythrocytosis, ↑PTHrP → hypercalcaemia, ↑renin → hypertension, ↑ACTH → Cushing’s)
    

### Spread

- Invades renal vein → IVC → lung, bone, brain metastases
    

### Diagnosis

- Abdominal & chest CT, biopsy, bone scan if bone pain
    

### Staging (TNM)

- T: size/local spread
    
- N: regional lymph nodes (N0/N1)
    
- M: metastasis (M0/M1)
    

### Treatment

- **Surgery (nephrectomy)** = mainstay (RCC resistant to chemo/radio)
    
- Immunotherapies: PD-1 inhibitors, IL-2
    
- Targeted therapy: VEGF pathway blockade

## Bladder Tumours

### Types

- **Urothelial carcinoma (TCC) – ~90%**
    
- Squamous cell carcinoma (rare in West, common with Schistosomiasis)
    

### Epidemiology & Risk Factors

- Older adults, men > women (3:1)
    
- Smoking
    
- Occupational exposures (painters, rubber, textile, metal industry; aniline dyes noted since 1894)
    

### Pathogenesis

- **Two molecular pathways**:
    
    - **Flat/non-papillary:** early TP53 mutation → aggressive, invasive
        
    - **Papillary:** FGFR3/RAS mutation, chr 9 deletions → low-grade, less aggressive, may later acquire TP53/RB mutations
        

### Precursor Lesions

- Carcinoma in situ (CIS – flat, red mucosa)
    
- Papillary urothelial carcinoma (non-invasive)
    

### Natural History

- Multifocal & recurrent (field effect or implantation theory)
    

### Clinical Features

- **Painless haematuria** (classic)
    
- Frequency, anaemia, pain
    
- Few physical signs
    

### Workup

- Urine cytology, cystoscopy, biopsy & resection
    
- Imaging (incl. upper tract, chest CT, bone scan if mets suspected)
    

### Pathologic Staging (TNM)

- **T1**: lamina propria
    
- **T2**: muscularis propria (detrusor)
    
- **T3**: perivesical fat
    
- **T4**: adjacent organs
    
- N0–N3: nodal mets
    
- M0–M1: distant mets
    

### Treatment

- **Non-muscle invasive (NMIBC):** resection ± intravesical chemo
    
- **Muscle-invasive (MIBC):** cystectomy/cystoprostatectomy, radiation, systemic chemo

## Key Takeaways

- **RCC:** silent, vascular, resistant to standard therapy → surgery is key
    
- **Bladder cancer:** mostly urothelial, strong link to smoking/occupational exposure, painless haematuria is a red flag
    
- Both staged via **TNM system**
    
- Genetic drivers: **VHL (RCC), TP53/RB/FGFR3 (bladder)**

Would you like me to also **reformat this into Anki-style Q&A cards** (with question, hint, answer, extra) so you can revise more effectively?
