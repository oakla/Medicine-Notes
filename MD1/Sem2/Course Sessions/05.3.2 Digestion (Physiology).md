# Overview
- carbs (CHO), proteins, & fats
- CHOs
	- broken down to monosaccharides (other wise pooped out)
	- enzymes: \<name\>ase
- Proteins
	- 
- Fats
## From gut lumen => gut cells => blood
- Enzymes + Transport
	- soluable enzymes
## [[Pancreas]]
- aside: delcious because it digests it self if removed
- exocrine and endocrine
- produces/secretes:
	- enzymes (from acinar cells) and alkalines
		- bicarbonate
- anatomy
	- connected to gut by 'dual purpose hole' 
		- pancreatic and bile juices enter gut together
### The major pancreatic enzymes
- know them!!

Pancreatic protection from enzymes
- trypsinogen => **trypsin** (via enterokinase/enteropetiase)
	- enterokinase: 
		- the scissors
		- only present in the small intestine
- trypsin activates enzymes (protesases)

Exocytosis pathway(s)
- CCK 

Duct cells
- bicarnonate to lumen
- H+ to blood

## Regulation of Pancreatic Secretion
- ACh
- **Secretin**
- **CCK**
- Somatostatin
	- generally inhibitory
### Phases
1.  ...
2. ....
3. ...
## Orifice
### Gall Blader and Bile
- **conversion**
	- conugated with glycine or taurine
	- gut flora undo this process (not desirable?)
- **recycling**
- Billiary System
	- **concentration**
		- overdone => gallstone (calcium + bilirubinate)


CCK & Secretin have inhibitory effect on gut tube (see previous lecture or end of lecture recording)
