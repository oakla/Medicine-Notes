# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts
- metering input duodenum
	- pyloric sphincter control
		- vago-vagal reflex
- 

# Notes
all stomach

- 4 regions; cardia, fundus, corpus (body), antrum
## Gastric Glands & Secretions
3 types of *exocrione* gland cells:
- mucous neck cells 
- parietal cells (intrinsic factor and HCl)
- chief cells (pepsinogen and gastric lipase[^1])
2 types of *endocrine* glands cells (and maybe more?)
- G-cell => gastrin => increase activity 
- D-cell => somatostatin => decrease activity

Not much point producing secreting acid in the stomach near the stomach exit. Acid is made in the top part

## stomach motor activity
- active relaxation - makes space for food
	- Food enters
		- stomach stretch triggers reflexes that relax stomach muscles
		- intrinsic and vago-vagal reflex
- mixing and grinding
	- pyloric sphincter closes during this process
	- regulated by stretch, ANS, osmo-receptors

- Pyloric sphincter opening
	- opens carefully to slowly introduce food to duodenum
	- duodenum feedback is largest influence on pyloric sphincter opening
		- signals; CCK, secretin
		- triggers: distension, pH, fat, amino acids, hypertonicity
		- pathways: short (intrinsic?) and 'long neural reflexex'
	- somewhat (less of) controlled by CNS signals too
### Vomiting
- regulated by CNS
- many possible triggers: upper GIT irritation, limbic system (emotions), blood chemicals (affecting medullary area postrema chem-receptors)

### Histology
- glands hidden/protected with 'gastric pits'
	- protective cells at top (i.e mucous cells)
	- mucous neck cells secerte alkaline mucous

## Acid
CO_2 + water (with catalyst carbonic anhydrase) => H_2CO_3 => H + HCO_3
- H+ pumped into lumen (K+ exchange)
- K+ leaks back into lumen
- Clleaks from ECF to Parietal cell to lumen
- lots of water follows to lumen (by osmolarity)

H+ production 
- in Parietal cell
- bicarbonate produced as by product => pumped back to ECF

### Production regulation
- receptors on parietal cells (ACh, Histamine, CCK-B (ligand: gastrin))
- proton pumps hang out in vesicles, waiting to deployed to cell membrane
- the three triggers are synergistic; ACh and Gastrin stimulate histamine release

### Gastrin 
- Release Regulation
	- stimulation
		- vagal
		- protein
		- antral distension
	- inhibition
		- ...
		- antagonism from D-cells (via somatostatin)
- Roles
	- ...

## Overall Regulation
- Parietal cells can be stimulated by gastrin, histamine, & ACh
- GRP => G-cell => (ECL =>) Parietal cell
- D-cell =| G-cell 

## Regulatory Mechanisms in the GI Phases
- cephalic
	- food smells, emotions, etc
- gastric
	- stomach stretch
- intestinal
	- gastric emptying
	- inhibitory effect on stomach
	- 

## Pepsin
- release stimulated by ACh, histamine (ECL) and Gastrin (G-cells)
## Stomach Protections
- pepsin is released as inactive form
- bicarbonate containing mucus layer secreted by mucous cells
	- Mucous cells cannot/do not produce bicarbonate
- mucous production regulated by **prostaglandins** 
	- NSAIDs can inhibit prostagladins (COX-1 PG formation)
# Questions

## My Questions
- are gastric pits the same thing as secretory sheaths?
