# Overview
- Foregut: Coeliac Artery (!)
	- 3 branches
		- Left gastric
		- ...
		- ...
- Caput Medusae
- Porto-caval anastamoses
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes

gut originates/grows from the yolksac 
- **a preservation of function** (still about nutrient supply to heart)
- blood supplied by the [[viteline system]]

coeliac branch very high up on aorta (as close to aortic hiatus as possible really)

pancreas parts maintain separate fore and mid gut. this is reflected in their blood supplies
- Dorsal pancreas supplied by coeliac artery
- Ventral pancreas supplied by SMA

## Foregut intraperitoneal arteries found within VENTRAL mesenteries
- left and right gastric ateries
- 
	- contents
	- porta hepatis - the primary doorway into the liver
## Foregut intraperitoneal arteries found within DORSAL mesenteries
- splenic
- those running near the lesser sac

## Anastomose of the small intestines
- no clear macro divide between mid and hind
- jejunum end:
	- smaller/shorter 'arcades'
	- longer 'vasa recta'
	- **because** the jejunum is further away from the SMA

## Large Intestines
- SMA branches
	1. inferior pancreatic duodenal
	2. top half (roughly) goes to jejunum
	3. Ileocolic
	4. 
- IMA branches
	1. Left colic (first branch you'll see if you push the Jej out of the way)

## The ‘axis’ of THE Mesentery
- J+I turn like a book
	- to the left reveals midgut
	- to the right reveals hindgut

## Portal System
- first pass metabolism
- Portl vein start = SMV + Splenic vien
- O2 supply 50/50 between portal artery and vein
## Knowledge Check
- make sure you can sketch the BV trees mentioned in the lecture
	- e.g. coeliac trunk and its branches
