Newer drugs target **specific mutant** or **over-expressed** proteins that drive malignancies

## Classic Treatments/Drugs

Classic drugs affected rapidly proliferating cells, usually by inferring with
- cell replication, or
- DNA
2nd degree malignancy


## Newer Drugs
### Leukaemia
Examples: AML, CLL, CML
Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML)
- Heterogenous disesae
Chronic Lymphoid Leukaemia (CLL)
- drive by hyperactive B cell signalling
Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML)
- homogeneous disease => targeted therapy very effective
- homogeneous disease → Chr 9q & Chr 22q reciprocal translocation short Chr 22 → Philadelphia Ch
- short Chr 22 → Philadelphia Chr
- 

-abs => antibodies
-ibs => small molecule inhibitors

### Kinases
- move phosphate to substrate (phosphorylate)
- involved in pathways of oncogenic mutations
- KI antagonise substrate
- Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK)
#### Imatinib

#### Trastuzumab


### Side Effects
dermal effects from [[Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)]]inhibitors

## Immunotherapy
- cancer blocks t cell CD8+ priming
- drugs inhibit the blocking - winning
- Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)
