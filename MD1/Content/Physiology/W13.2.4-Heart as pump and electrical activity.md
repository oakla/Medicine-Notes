- dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR)
	- present on cell membrane
	- L-type (i.e. slow type => open for ~300ms)
- Ryanodine receptors
	- present on the sarcomere
	- triggered by Ca presence => releases Ca from sarcoplasmic reticulum
- SERCA (sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase)
	- Calcium pump
	- present on cell membrane
- Ca exchanger
	- secondary active transport
	- Na/Ca exchange
	- target of a lot of pharmacology
