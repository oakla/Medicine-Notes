Extracellular Ca is more important than in Skeletal Muscle
Calcium Channels & Pumps
- dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR)
	- present on cell membrane
	- L-type (i.e. slow type => open for ~300ms)
- Ryanodine receptors
	- present on the sarcomere
	- triggered by Ca presence => releases Ca from sarcoplasmic reticulum
- SERCA (sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase)
	- Calcium pump
	- present on cell membrane
- Ca exchanger
	- secondary active transport
	- Na/Ca exchange
	- target of a lot of pharmacology

## Notes
DHPR is the calcium receptor on the surface of a muscle cell
Ca pump CICR
2 Ca pumps on cell membrane
- Na-Ca exchanger (NCX)
	- 2ndary active transport
	- pumps Ca out of the cell
	- target for a lot of pharma
	- anitport
- RyR2
	- Ca in cell stims release of more Ca from SarcoPR
