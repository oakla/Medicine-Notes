Extracellular Ca is more important than in Skeletal Muscle
Calcium Channels & Pumps
- dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR)
	- present on cell membrane
	- L-type (i.e. slow type => open for ~300ms)
- Ryanodine receptors
	- present on the sarcomere
	- triggered by Ca presence => releases Ca from sarcoplasmic reticulum
- SERCA (sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase)
	- Calcium pump
	- present on cell membrane
- Ca exchanger
	- secondary active transport
	- Na/Ca exchange
	- target of a lot of pharmacology


## Physiology
- feed-forward vs predictive control
	- can be the same thing
	- predictive control - having a plan ready to go (anticipatory)
	- parametric feed-forward 
		- system can learn
		- includes predictive control
- muscle receptors: GTO vs muscle spindle
	- muscle spindle has ???
- ....
- 1347: two type of GFR reg
	- Glomelular feedback 
		- based on flowrate
		- lower flowrate => lower salt => activate RAAS
	- **1353: what is the main driving force that makes RAAS increase GFR**
- ECG:
	- whats a P wave, QRS segment, T wave
	- **draw a tension graph!** (esp of ventricle)
	- amplitude doesn't matter
	- overlap of membrane potential and contraction
	- **Wiggers Diagram**
	- e.g. where does mitral valve open? (**make sure you understand this**)
- cardiac muscle AP
	- how to tell between contratile cell and pace maker cell (long gating?)
- LV pressure
- Increase HR => shorter diastolic filling time => decreased pre-load (LVEDV)
- Be able to **predict effects in physiology lab**
	- very important to understanding
- ~**1422**: *Marcus*: phys lab effects are based on responses of a healthy person. Can you predict what happes if you take away:
	- blood volume
	- muscle pump
	- ?
	- adrenals

## Notes
DHPR is the calcium receptor on the surface of a muscle cell
Ca pump CICR
2 Ca pumps on cell membrane
- Na-Ca exchanger (NCX)
	- 2ndary active transport
	- pumps Ca out of the cell (and sodium in)
	- target for a lot of pharma
	- anitport
- RyR2
	- Ca in cell stims release of more Ca from SarcoPR
