Only 2 layers (functionally speaking)
(Anatomically there are more)

Regeneration:
- epidermis is easy because it's always making new stuff anyway (i.e. always regenerating)
- dermis is slow/more difficult (usually doesn't unless its a wound)
	- is vascular -> there's a mess and immune response
	- requires fibroblasts which will the wound with fibres regardless of what was there before (i.e. scars)
- Wound repair stages
	- epidermis: there are none
	- dermis:
		1. inflammation
		2. new tissue formation
		3. remodelling
			- might look a bit better
			- requires irregular collagen to be remodelled
			- absence of normal apendages (e.g. usually no sweat glands in scars)
- burns
	- depth dependent: 3 degrees - 3rd is all of dermis and potentially beyond
- Thermoreceptors
	- ranges of temperature for receptor activation
		- min and max (e.g. too cold does not trigger cold sensation (pain instead))
		- overlap of activation of hot and cold
- Vitamin D
	- we produce it easily in Australia
- Thermoregulation
	- "evolved late" -> "weird shit" (because it's retrofitted)
	- evap cooling
	- convective cooling
		- vaso constriciton
