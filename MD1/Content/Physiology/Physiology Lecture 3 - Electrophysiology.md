## Learning Outcomes
• Know the composition of different body fluid compartments
• Explain the ionic basis of membrane potentials
• Describe & explain the ionic basis of electrical signaling in nerve and muscle cells (action potentials)
• Explain the process of sensory transduction
• Describe how action potentials are propagated along membranes


Terms
- resting membrane potential

### How does the cell maintain a negative charge (Resting Membrane Potential)
#### [[The Gibbs-Donnan effect]]
- -ve protein ions contribute to RMP significantly
	- proteins get produced **inside** cells -> 
	- things in aqueous solution often ionise, ->
	- proteins usually ionise as anions^[1] and H+
	- H+ can easily leave the cell


### Important Infrastructure for MP process
- Ligand gated Na channels
- Voltage gated Na channels
- Voltage K Channels


K leaks out of the cell. This is good because it means that there is always some spare K to pump back in to keep the Na+/K+ Pump 

Diffusion is predominately determined by 
- membrane permeability, and then, to a lesser extent 
- concentration, and
- voltage (not nearly as powerful as the other two)

molecule – most proteins have pI<7.25 so carry –ve charge"
