1. Cardiac dysfunction
2. Shock â€“ the basics
3. Heart failure (pathological aspects)


## [[Shock]]
main thing: "What happens and why"
### Causes/Triggers
three main mechanisms
- intravascular volume depletion
- cardiac failure
- microvascular damage

### Classification
- cardiogenic
- hypovolemic
- systemic inflammation associated

### Outcomes


### Stages of Shock
1. Initial '**non-progressive/compensated stage**'
2. A **"progressive stage**
3. An "**irreversible stage**"

In hospital, sometimes goes unnoticed as internal bleed

## [[Heart Failure]]
- heart cannot pump enough (or can only do so at elevated filling pressure (elevated pre-load))

Adaptations:
- [[Frank-Starling]]

### Causes
- chronic work overload
	- chronic valve disease, HTN
- IHD
- Acute Haemodynamic Stress
	- Fluid overload, AMI, acute valve dysfunction
