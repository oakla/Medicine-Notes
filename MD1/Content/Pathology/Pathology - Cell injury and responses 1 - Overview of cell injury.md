## Overview
### Learning Outcomes
- Discuss the possible causes of cell/tissue injury.
- Discuss the possible outcomes for a cell subjected to stress or injury
- Discuss the changes in cellular appearance and function resulting from cell injury
- Discuss how tissues react to cell injury
- Define the terms hyperplasia, hypertrophy, atrophy, metaplasia, necrosis, apoptosis, autophagy, ischaemia, infarction 
- Outline how tissue may demonstrate abnormal deposition of pigments, calcium and other materials and the significance of this

### Outline
1. Major concepts
2. Causes and mechanisms of cell injury
3. Non-Lethal Injury
	1. Reversible cell injury
	2. Patterns of Adaptation
4. Lethal Injury
	1. Necrosis
	2. Apoptosis
	3. (Autophagy)

### Causes and mechanisms of cell injury
### Non-Lethal Injury
#### Reversible cell injury
#### Patterns of Adaptation
