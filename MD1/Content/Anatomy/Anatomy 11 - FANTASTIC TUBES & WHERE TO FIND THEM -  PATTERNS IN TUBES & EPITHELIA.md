learning-outcomes:
  - Define each type of epithelia & describe the respective functions/purpose of each, and describe which embryological germ layer each epithelium/tissue is derived from
  - Describe the different layers of tube structures and understand how they change with function/body site
  - Describe the structure of blood tubes and how to identify/differentiate them

## Notes

### Epithelium

Layer classifications:
- [[Simple]]
- [[Pseudostratified]]
- [[Stratified]]

Cell Shape classifications:
- Squamous (fried egg)
- Cuboidal (cube)
- Columnar (rectangle)
Tissue classification is based on shape of cells closest to lumen
### Splanchnopleure (endodermal) tubes
have glands
- Lumen
- Mucosa
- Submucosa
- Muscularis externa
- Adventitia
- Serosa

The lumen is typically folded to allow for dilation and contraction of the tube. (Note that the circular muscle layer need not be folded. It can maintain its circular shape even when changing size/width)
#### Gut tube
#### Small intestine
#### Respiratory tubes
#### trachea
#### bronchi
#### Bronchioles 
#### Alveoli
#### Blood vessels
#### Arteries
#### Veins
#### Capillaries
### Endodermal tubes
