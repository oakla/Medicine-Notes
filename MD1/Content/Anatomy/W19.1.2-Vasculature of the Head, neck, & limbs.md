### **Artery patterns** in limb vessels  
 
 General Organization
 - Originate from 'girdle level' and run ventrally (flexion side)
 Pattern of key arterial braches
 - 1 proximal major
 - 1 deep
 - 2 circumflex
Distal arteries
- named for bones they run beside
	- 2 in arm
	- 3 in lower limb (a&p tibial, 1x fibular)
Anastomoses

### Periarticular Anastomoses


### Venous Drainage Patterns
deep and superficial 
both have valces
sk mus helps flow

Deep veins
- typically accompany arteries
Superficial veins
- thermo reg
- cannulation
