- Describe the **basic process of facial development** and identify the relevant embryonic anatomy, and how errors can result in facial defects

- Describe the different developmental characteristics of the **neurocranium** and **viscerocranium**

- Describe the way that **cranial nerves** are numbered, identify them on a brainstem image, understand the developmental basis of the things they innervate (e.g. from somites, special sense capsule, pharyngeal arch)

- Identify and describe the **components and development of the pharyngeal arches**, and how they contribute to the anatomy of the adult
	- 5 Pharyngeal Arches
		- 1st Maxillary and mandibular swellings
		- 2nd Hyoid
