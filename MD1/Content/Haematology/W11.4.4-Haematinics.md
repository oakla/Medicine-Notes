Key Concepts/Terms
- [[Erythropoietin]]


### [[Erythropoietin]]
- **matures RBCs** 
- **short half life**. 
- **Long acting analogues**: Modified versions created to meet pharmacological needs =>
	- Darbepoetin
	- Peginesatide (Withdrawn due to safety concerns)
- Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESAs) 
	- indications
		- anaemia (chronic kidney disease, chemo, AIDS)
		- autologous blood yield
	- side effects
		- e.g.
			- malignancy
			- clots
			- CVS complications
		- Hb corrected to target (not necessarily to 'normal' levels)

## [[Iron]]
the body can't deliberately excrete iron
absorption can be blocked (via use of hepcidin)
supplementation 
- side effects
	- GI side effects (black stools, diahharea)
- absorption 
	- is erratic
	- improved by give higher, less frequent doses (e.g. once per day)
Toxicity
- free iron (not bound to protein) can do a lot of damage 
- fatal does is pretty low LD50 0.3g/kg
- antidote: Desferoxamine -> iron chelator
Intravenous:
- works pretty well
- possible side effects
	- staining
	- pathogenesis
	- hyper phospho
- iron wrapped in carbohydrate shell
- triggers a inflammatory response


## B12 and Folate
each plays a role separate metabolic pathways that intersect
- needed in 
	- DNA synthesis
	- erythropoietic cycle
-  deficiency => macrocytic anemia
- should replace B12 before folate => metabolic b12 pathway is downstream, so fixing that is a good idea
#### B12 Supplementation
- cobalamins

B6
B2
