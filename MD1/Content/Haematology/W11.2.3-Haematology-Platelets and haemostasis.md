### ðŸ”¬ **Primary Haemostasis: Platelets**

|#|Topic|Question|Hint|Answer|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Adhesion|What protein links subendothelial collagen to platelets during adhesion?|Itâ€™s deficient in von Willebrand disease.|**Von Willebrand Factor (vWF)**|
|2|Adhesion|Which glycoprotein receptor on platelets binds to von Willebrand Factor?|It's a complex of GPIb, V, and IX.|**GPIb/V/IX**|
|3|Adhesion|Which receptor on platelets directly binds collagen?|Itâ€™s a glycoprotein VI.|**GPVI**|
|4|Adhesion|What integrin on platelets also helps bind to collagen?|Known as Î±2Î²1 integrin.|**GPIa/IIa**|
|5|Activation|Which molecule is synthesized by activated platelets and promotes further activation and aggregation?|Derived from arachidonic acid.|**Thromboxane A2**|
|6|Activation|Name two types of granules released during platelet activation.|One type contains clotting proteins, the other has small molecules like ADP.|**Alpha granules and Dense granules**|
|7|Aggregation|What glycoprotein receptor cross-links platelets via fibrinogen during aggregation?|Itâ€™s the target of some anti-platelet drugs.|**GPIIb/IIIa**|

### ðŸ§¬ **Secondary Haemostasis: Coagulation Cascade**
| #   | Topic            | Question                                                                                    | Hint                                                      | Answer                    |
| --- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 8   | Initiation       | What complex initiates the extrinsic pathway of coagulation?                                | Starts with tissue factor.                                | **TF-FVIIa complex**      |
| 9   | Initiation       | Which factor is directly activated by TF-FVIIa to generate small amounts of thrombin?       | Activated by both intrinsic and extrinsic.                | **FX (Factor X)**         |
| 10  | Amplification    | What enzyme is generated in small amounts during initiation and then amplifies the cascade? | Converts fibrinogen to fibrin.                            | **Thrombin (Factor IIa)** |
| 11  | Amplification    | Which two coagulation factors are activated by thrombin in the amplification phase?         | These cofactors boost the intrinsic pathway.              | **FV and FVIII**          |
| 12  | Intrinsic        | Which pathway involves FXII, FXI, FIX and FVIII?                                            | Activated by artificial surfaces in vitro.                | **Intrinsic pathway**     |
| 13  | Extrinsic        | Which pathway is initiated by exposure of tissue factor?                                    | Tests include PT/INR.                                     | **Extrinsic pathway**     |
| 14  | Fibrin formation | What factor converts fibrin monomers into a stable fibrin clot?                             | A transglutaminase also called fibrin-stabilizing factor. | **Factor XIIIa**          |
