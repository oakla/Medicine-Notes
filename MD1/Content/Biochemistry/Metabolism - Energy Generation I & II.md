## Notes

"all our carbs can be processed in glycolysis"

ADP and AMP increase enzyme activity

most of the focus is on PFK1

know what hexokinase does
- traps glucose by giving it a negative charge (from phosphate group) at physiological/neutral Ph

glycolysis
- pyruvate produced
- aerobic glycolysis
- anaerobic glycolysis


Glycolysis
- name three key enzymes that catalyze irreversible reactions in glycolysis
	- Hexokinase
	- PFK1
	- Pyruvate Kinase
- From glucose (6C), 2 x ADP and 2 x NAD+, Glycolysis produces 
	- 2 x pyruvate (3C)
	- 2 x ATP
	- 2 x NADH

Next step - TCA cycle
Transport pyruvate into mitochondria where the TCA cycle happens

Pyruvate (3C) -> Acetyl CoA (2C) inside mitochondria
- releases first oxidised O as CO2
- via Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH)
	- dehydrogenase -> therefore *Redox* reaction
	- highly regulated
		- controlled by phosphorylation
		- inputs (Pyruvate, NAD+) turn it on via inactivating Kinase thus allowing Phosphatase to activate PDH
		- products (Acetyl CoA, NADH) turn it off via 'Kinase' 
#### TCA cycle
- input: acetyle CoA
- recycles oxaloacetate -> combines with acetyle CoA to produce citrate which restarts the cycle

Anaerobic energy production
1. Glycolysis turns glucose into pyruvate (producing ATP along the way)
2. Pyruvate converted into lactic acid -> NAD+ to continue glycolysis (lactate dehydrogenase)
3. Lactate is cleared in the liver by converting to pyruvate and then glucose (gluconeogenesis) using lactate dehydrogenase (again)

Glycolysis
- name three key enzymes that catalyze irreversible reactions in glycolysis
	- Hexokinase
	- PFK1
- From glucose (6C), 2 x ADP and 2 x NAD+, Glycolysis produces 
	- 2 x pyruvate (3C)
	- 2 x ATP
	- 2 x NADH

Which has higher energy NADH or NAD+
- NADH

Which has higher energy pyruvate or Acetyl CoA?
- Acetyl CoA


Why is lactate produced in anaerobic conditions?
- it is a biproduct of pyruvate being used to regenerate NAD+ (oxidise NADH back to NAD+)

How do we clear lactate? 
- in the Cori Cycle
