important connection to G6P in carb metabolism biochem lectures (pentose phos pathway)


Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can cause Favism (jaundice and red urine after eating Fava beans)
- G6PD deficiency often caused by gene variants
- gene is X-linked recessive

How does G6PD def cause favism?
