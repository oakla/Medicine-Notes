## Notes
- Gram-positive
	- refers to a positive result to a dark gram stain 
	- indicates a think cell wall
- [[Staphylococcus]], [[Streptococcus]], and [[Enterococcus]] are the most common genera of aerobic (or facultative anaerobic) gram-positive cocci found in clinical samples
- Staphylococcus identification
	- microscopy: can be visually differentiated (under microscopy) from strep & entero its collective arrangement of individual cells
	- chemically: staphylococci produce an enzyme that catalyses H202 breakdown. Staphylocci + hydrogen peroxide will vigorously produce gas.
