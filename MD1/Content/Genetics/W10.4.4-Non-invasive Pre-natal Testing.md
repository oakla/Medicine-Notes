Screening VS Diagnostics
- screening is cheaper, diagnostics more specific
- most things are the same between them
- difference in the genetics case:
	- screening is expensive
	- screening sometimes IS the diagnostic test

**NIPT** has fewer false positives than Traditional **combined first trimester screening** (cFTS)

Cell free DNA is loose DNA found in plasma
NIPT requires sufficient fetal/maternal fraction of cfDNA

all chromosome contribution to cfDNA is stable across 'healthy' individuals => diversions indicate a problem

Positive predictive value PPV is affected by prior risk:
- maternal age
- Population prevalence
- Patient specific factors
- Type of aneuploidy

Biological False Positives
- aneuploidy only effects trophoblast - "confined placenta mosaicism"
- demised twin
- maternal neoplasm
