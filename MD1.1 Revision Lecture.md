# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes

## Anatomy
- 13:XX intersegmentals 
	- are paired because somites are paired
	- blood supply comes from dorsal aorta (which originates from somites too)
- 1332: connecting arteries of the thorax
## Physiology
- feed-forward vs predictive control
	- can be the same thing
	- predictive control - having a plan ready to go (anticipatory)
	- parametric feed-forward 
		- system can learn
		- includes predictive control
- muscle receptors: GTO vs muscle spindle
	- muscle spindle has ???
- â€¦.
- 1347: two type of GFR reg
	- Glomelular feedback 
		- based on flowrate
		- lower flowrate => lower salt => activate RAAS
	- **1353: what is the main driving force that makes RAAS increase GFR**
- ECG:
	- whats a P wave, QRS segment, T wave
	- **draw a tension graph!** (esp of ventricle)
	- amplitude doesn't matter
	- overlap of membrane potential and contraction
	- **Wiggers Diagram**
	- e.g. where does mitral valve open? (**make sure you understand this**)
- cardiac muscle AP
	- how to tell between contratile cell and pace maker cell (long gating?)
- LV pressure
- Increase HR => shorter diastolic filling time => decreased pre-load (LVEDV)
- Be able to **predict effects in physiology lab**
	- very important to understanding
- ~**1422**: *Marcus*: phys lab effects are based on responses of a healthy person. Can you predict what happes if you take away:
	- blood volume
	- muscle pump
	- ?
	- adrenals
## Pathology (Marcus)
- If someone asked, can you explain X to me, can you do it
	- e.g.
		- what is inflammation
		- an infarction is one of the ways that necrosis happens
- know what terms mean
- can you recognise it in a macroscopic specimen
- classification
- can i work out whats going on now, and
- how did we get to this point (not always relevant)
- what's going to happen next?
- go through worksheets of each tutorial ("we look at these sheets before we write the exam")
	- esp for the OSPE
	- e.g. its a heart, there's a red thing sticking to the wall, what does that mean
- necrosis: dead tissue is white NOT BLACK

- **'banana' configuration** (what?)
