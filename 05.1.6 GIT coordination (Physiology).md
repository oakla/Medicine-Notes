# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
- Outline how gastrointestinal function, metering and motility is **control**led.
- Construct the correct sequence in the **phases of digestion** (ie, Cephalic, Gastric and Intestinal)
- Describe how the **movement of chyme through the gastrointestinal tract is co-ordinated** to optimize the digestion and absorption of nutrients
- List the **major hormones, other peptides, and key neurotransmitters** of the gastrointestinal system.
- Describe the special features of the **enteric nervous system**
## Outline/Sections
- Chemical Digestion
- Mechanical Digestion

## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes

Gut movement
Controllers
- Basal Electrical Rhythm (BER)
- 
ANS + hormones + paracrines + BER => smooth muscle movement patterns

BER is a slow continual ebbing and flowing of cell membrane potential. In itself it does not cause an action potential

Mechanical
1. Migrating Motor Complex (MMC)
2. local churning (breaking down food)
3. peristalsis - propulsion

Migrating Motor Complex
- single wave that moves through the gut
- starts 
	- periodically (every ~90 minutes)
	- when you're not eating
- clears everything out
- goes for  90-120 min
- stops when you start eating (via input from extrinsic NS)


- During absorption
	- Peristalsis
		- retrograde contraction + anterograde relaxation
		- moves anterograde
		- driven by aceytlcholine
	- Segmentation/grinding
		- initiated by stretch
		- localised churning of chyme
	- For peristalsis and segmentation/grinding
		- **Occurence** independent of extrincsic innervation
		- Frequency/strength is increased (PNS) or decreased (SNS) by the ANS

Colon Motility
- slow - lots of time to absorb water
- entrance controlled by ileocaecal valve

GI Sphincters - metering
- lots of sphincters
- controlled by myogenic tone (ANS, ENS, reflexes, hormones) and relative pressure
- pressure before sphincter => open
- pressure after sphincter => extra closed (to prevent retrograde flow)
- acetylycholine 
	- direct => constriction
	- via interneurons => relaxation

- defecation
	- parasympathetic nervous system causes interal anal sphincter to relax
	- external is under voluntary control
### Neural Control
The ENS has direct influence over GI smooth muscle and is influenced by the ANS (PNS increases activity and SNS decreases activity)

ENS - 2 plexuses
One does mechanical digestion, the other does chemical digestion
- myenteric plexus -- GI tract motility
	- mainly coordinates longitudinal muscle movement
	- **mechanical** digestion
- submucosal plexus -- controlling secretions
	- mainly coordinates local secretion and local blood flow
	- **chemical** digestions
### GIT reflexes - 3 types
- intrinsic reflexes
	- short, ENS only
	- all the things - secretion, peristalsis, mixing, local effects
- extrinsic reflexes
	- GIT => prevertebral ganglia => GIT
	- examples:
		- Enterogastric reflex: acidic duodenum => inhibits stomach activity
		- Gastrocolic reflex: stomach strech => increases colon motility
		- gastroileal reflex: stomach stretch => opens ileocaecal valve
- long reflexes
	- vago-vagal
	- pain reflex: inhibits entire gut
	- defecation reflex
