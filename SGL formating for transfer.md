Outline each element of Virchow’s triad and its contribution to the formation of
thrombi.

Virchow’s triad:
- Endothelial injury
	- leads to platelet activation via activation of thrombin due to downregulation of thrombomodulin by endothelial cells that are activated by cytokines. Activated endothelial cells also secrete plasminogen activator inhibitors limiting fibrinolysis.
	- E.g Hypercholesterolaemia, systemic inflammation are conditions that predispose to endothelial injury.
- Abnormal Blood flow (stasis/turbulence)
	- Lead to thrombus by promoting endothelial cell activation.
	- Disruption of laminar flow leading to platelets contacting endothelium.
	- Prevent dilution of activated clotting factors.
- Hypercoagulability
	- Any disorder of the blood that predisposes to thrombus formation.
	- Can be inherited e.g. Factor V Leiden. FVL has a mutation that means factor V is resistant to cleavage and inactivation.
	- Can be acquired e.g. Neoplasia; tumours can produce procoagulant factors.


| Mechanism                                  | Explanation                                                                                 |

| **Turbulent flow**                         | Disrupts laminar flow, causing **endothelial damage** and **local activation of platelets** |
| **Stasis (sluggish flow)**                 | Allows clotting factors to **accumulate** and **not be washed away** by normal circulation  |
| **Brings platelets closer to endothelium** | In laminar flow, platelets stay near the center; turbulence moves them to vessel walls      |
