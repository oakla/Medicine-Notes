(note: not watch lecture for 1st 10 minutes)
**Na pump on basal side of cell**


CHO absorption
1. breakdown to monosaccharides
	- does not break down to glucose in (context?)
2. absoroption of monosaccharides
	1. fructose only icked up by diffusion
Disaccharides
- ...
Lactase deficiency (i.e. lactose intolerance)
- ...
### Protein Digestion
Amino acid uptake
PepT1
- peptide transporter (not AA transporter)
prions can get through sometimes


## Lipids
bile salt == bile acid

Digestion
- lipase

Absorption
- detours via lymph to distribute FAAs


Transport
- "nothing new" (so make sure you know it - revise previous lectures)

## Water and electrolyte absorption

### Water
- most absorbed by small int.
- large fine tunes
## Na

## Cl
- Na follows Cl (and vice versa?)
- related to cystic fibrosis (CFTR)
#### CFTR
- ...
## K
- driven by Na
- K by paracellular diffusion because high cellular K conc 
- low % of ingested (lots re-excreted)

## Mineral Absorption (others)
- bioavailability varies depending things

### Ca
- we're bad at absorption
- transcellular
	- e-cytes keep intracellular Ca low
	- transport switched on by vitamin D
- paracellular
	- a little bit
### Mg
- low intracellular conc drives diffusion via transporter

### Fe
**ferroportin**
- haem vs non-haem
	- non-haem comes as Fe^2+ and Fe^3+ (insoluable)
	- can't absorb Fe^3+
- can absorb haem and Fe^2+
- lumen => DMT => ...
- Fe is toxic so we have mech for getting rid of it
- Ferroportin turned off when Fe levels too high
	- Fe stays stored in Enterocyctes
