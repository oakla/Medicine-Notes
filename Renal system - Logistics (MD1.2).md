# Key Concepts

## Core Conditions[^1]
### 3+ and 2+

| Level | Renal                      | Urology                   |
| ----- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 3+    | Chronic kidney disease<br> |                           |
|       | Urinary tract infection    | Urinary tract infection   |
| 2+    | Carcinoma of kidney        |                           |
| 2+    | Diabetic nephropathy       | Urinary tract obstruction |
|       | Hypertensive renal disease | Vesico-ureteric reflux    |
|       | Acute kidney injury        | Urinary retention         |
### 1+
- Renal artery stenosis
- Nephritic syndrome
- Nephrotic syndrome
- Glomerulonephritis
- Congenital malformations of the urogenital tract
- Wilm's tumour
- Polycystic kidney disease
- Renal transplantation

## Teacher Emphasis / Lecture Hints

## Phys
- what is Glomerular blood hydrostatic pressure[^2]
- the kidneys filter 36x blood volume per day (i.e. ${ 36 \times 5\ L = 180\ L }$, or ${125\ ml/min}$)
### Micro - UTIs
"Easily testable facts"
- Escherichia coli (specifically, UPEC) most common cause of UTI
- Staphylococcus saprophyticus (supposedly) a cause of UTI in young adult females ("honeymoon cystitis")
- Staph aureus and candida spp in urine might indicate bloodstream infection
- Which common uropathogens produce nitrate reductase (E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp), and which do not (Staphylococcus spp, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus faecalis)
- Standard threshold for bacterial growth reporting in urine is â‰¥10*8 colony forming units (CFU)/L
- Some antibiotics (nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin) are good for cystitis, but inappropriate for pyelonephritis etc because they don't reach adequate concentration in kidney tissue/blood

Long Answer Qs
- Describe the pathophysiology of UTI and how it relates to risk factors for UTI
- Describe the indications for treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and reasons why
