# What you need to know for pathology
### [Environmental lung disease](app://obsidian.md/Environmental%20lung%20disease)

Includes

- Mesothelioma
- Lung cancer
- COPD/emphysema
- Occupational lung disease/pnuemoconiosis

Could you

- Outline some common occupational exposures that can lead to lung disease?
- Outline and briefly describe the various occupational lung diseases. Examples include - Asbestosis, Malignant Mesothelioma, Occupational Asthma, Silicosis, Coal workers' Pneumoconiosis, Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Occupational lung cancer?

### Chronic lung disease (e.g. COPD, pulmonary fibrosis)

- Compare and contrast [Obstructive and Restrictive Lung Diseases](app://obsidian.md/Obstructive%20and%20Restrictive%20Lung%20Diseases)
    - Recognise and explain obstructive and restrictive patterns based on lung function tests and clinical/pathological findings
- Define and describe [COPD](app://obsidian.md/COPD) and the specific diseases that are included in this category  
    - Describe characteristics of COPD in regards to the following:  
    - Patterns of airway obstruction  
    - Main pathological findings  
    - Risk factors and co-morbidities that can contribute to the development of COPD and its exacerbation  
- Minimum:
	- Recognise obstructive pattern and restrictive pattern on LFTs.
	- Know the main diseases for each category.
	- COPD (CB and emphysema) are common.
	- Asthma is common.
	- Other obstructive diseases less common.

#### Interstitial lung disease

As a category, it is common. BUT, each individual disease in this category is relatively uncommon.

- What are the key examples? (see lecture)

They all vary in incidence and specific clinical features, radiology, pathology, and management.

### Neoplasms

Classificaion: Do you know the following tumours (risk factors, morphology, principles of staging/grading/major subtypes)?

- Lung: Small cell, Non-small cell (squamous cell Ca, AdenoCa, undifferentiated, other), carcinoid
- Pleura: Mesothelioma
- [Other (sarcomas, leukaemia/lymphoma/myeloma, etc)]  
    Key aspects for diagnosis and management.
- Symptoms and signs: when to consider lung Ca  
    Primary vs metastasis
- Management and presentation differences for different subtypes
- Making a diagnosis - testing

### Respiratory infections

Describe characteristics of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in regards to the following:

- Risk factors and co-morbidities that can contribute to the development of CAP
- The common pathogens
- Clinical presentation including relevant aspects of history and examination.
- Common pathological patterns (bronchopneumonia, lobar pneumonia, tuberculosis, abscesses)
- Discuss the protection, prevention and treatment strategies in regards to community-acquired pneumonia

### Asthma

Could you:

- Define asthma. Include a description of the change in structure and function of respiration in asthma including the clinical features (signs and symptoms).
- Outline some potential triggers/risk factors (avoidable & unavoidable triggers).
- Describe the pathological features in acute and chronic asthma

### Macro examples in the SGL:

- Tuberculosis (different forms, do you understand why they occur?)
- Lung infarcts and pulmonary embolus
- Bronchiectasis
- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s)
- MIXED cases – multiple pathologies co-existing are common in lung disease due to shared aetiologies (e.g. smoking, pneumoconiosis) or problems that arise secondary to an earlier problem (e.g. obstruction due to carcinoma causing pneumonia)

### Background basic pathological knowledge (sem 1 stuff)

To understand the entities on the previous slides you need to review and understand (well):

- Hypersensitivity reactions
    - _GPA_
    - _pulmonary fibrosis_
- How cancers develop
    - _knudson hypothesis_
    - 'more than just angiogenesis'
        - learn what the cells themselve are doing
- Bacterial and viral infections, bacteraemia, tuberculosis, immunocompromise
- Interplay between genetics and environment in aetiology of lung disease
