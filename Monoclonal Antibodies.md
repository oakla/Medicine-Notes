## Monoclonal Antibody Therapy (MAT)
Monoclonal Antibodies are used therapeutically by:
- suppressing an over active immune system (e.g. CD20 B Cell depletion)
- impairing activity of cytokines (e.g. in [[Multiple Sclerosis (MS)]])
- Suppressing Immune checkpoint inhibitors (Immune Checkpoint Blockade)
	- increasing T Cell activation (e.g. when T cells have be suppressed by cancer)

### MAT in Autoimmune diseases
#### CD20 B Cell depletion
MAT can provide antibodies which cause [[Antibody Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity]] (ADCC). 
CD20 is not expressed on pro-B cells (precursor B cells) or plasma cells (which descend from B cells), but it is expressed on B cells in lymph nodes and in circulation. 

### MAT in cancer treatment
MAT can be used to treat cancer by
- blocking signals
	- e.g. 
		- block EGFRs on tumours
		- block VEGF communication (stops angiogenesis)
- tagging tumour cells for destruction
	- antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity
- Immune Checkpoint Blockade
	- cancers produce signals that suppress T cell activity (i.e. stop T cells from destroying the tumour)
	- MAT can inhibit T cell suppression signals from the cancer (e.g. CTLA4 suppression)
