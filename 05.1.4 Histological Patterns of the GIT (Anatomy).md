# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes
The gut tube starts at the oesophagus and ends with the anus. The common muscular pattern along the tube is longitudinal muscle in the outer layer, circular (or helical) muscle in the inner layer 
## Oesophagus
- stratified squamous epithelium
- skeletal muscles in the upper oesophagus
- smooth muscle in the lower oesophagus
- glands in mucosa and larger glands in the submucosa
## Stomach
From hereon in, the epithelium is all simple columnar epithelium (until we get to the anus). 

Secretes acid and enzymes (which protects against pathogens) and mucous (which protects against the acid)

Glands in the tube wall of the stomach are partially protected by **secretory sheaths**, which are like tunnels that glands hide in away from stomach acid. More distall sheaths are typically longer than more proximal ones. 

Stomach Glands
- chief cells 
	- produce **pepsinogen**
		- pepsinogen is the inactive form of pepsin
	- basophillic (due to lots of rER)
- parietal cells 
	- produce HCl
	- **acidophillic**
	- found on the *parietal* side of the gland
- G-cells
	- secrete **gastrin**
		- gastrin triggers parietal cells to secrete HCl
- D-cells
	- produce somatostatin(?)

*Upper stomach* glands
- straight orientation
- chief cells 
- parietal cells
- G-cells
- D-cells
*Lower stomach* 
- coiled with deep pits
- mainly chief cells

Regions of the stomach
- Cardiac
	- cardia
	- cardiac notch
	- cardiac sphincter - controlled "structurally" and lines up with the diaphragm from which it needs help to close itself
- Fundus
- Body
- Pyloric antrum
- Pyloric Canal
- Pyloric Sphincter
## Duodenum
- means '12 fingers' because it's 12 fingers long (more or less)
- large villi  (outies) + crypts (innies)
	- crypts are negative projections that extend to the bottom of the mucosa
- Contains large submucosal glands which 
	- have ducts which connect to the crypts
	- secrete alkaline mucus
- has plicae circulares (more so towards the jejunum (i.e. distally))
- retro or intra peritoneal?
	- most of the duodenum is **retroperitoneal**
	- intraperitoneal at the pyloric and jejunal junctions (i.e. beginning and end)
- Two entrances:
	- the pyloric sphincter - acid and chyme 
	- duodenal papilla - billary secretions (and pancreatic enzymes?)
## Jejunum/Ileum
Generally:
- simple columnar with microvilli 
- goblet cells
- no submucosal glands
- plicae circularis (PC)
- main job is absorption
	- lots of blood vessels - carb and protein transport
	- lympathatic vessels (lacteals) - fat transport
- no clear morphological boundary between jejunum and ileum
- Paneth cells 
	- secrete lysozyme
	- mostly in the ileum

Peyer's Patches 
- found only in ileum
- contain mucosal associated lymphiod tissue (MALT)

|                 | Jejunum      | Ileum           |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| extent          | upper 2/5ths | lower 3/5ths    |
| PC              | many         | fewer           |
| villi           | larger       | thinner/smaller |
| crypts          | shorter      | deeper          |
| goblet cells    | some         | more            |
| optimised for   | wetter chyme | drier chyme     |
| peyer's patches | none         | some            |

## Colon
- 5 parts:
	- 3 vertical parts are retroperitoneal
	- 2 horizontal segments are intraperitoneal
- because of drying bolus
	- even *more* gobet cells
	- no villi, only crypts
- moves slowly (up to 18 hours)
	- female gut is typically longer and slower
- taeniae coli - 3 strips that help with propulsion

## Rectum then Anus
- distinct nerve and blood supply
- both sphincters are innervated from the same spinal roots (S 2, 3 & 4) but **different nerves**

Anorectal Junction
- marked by the pectinate (comb)
- histologically, hilton white line separates segments
### Rectum
- simple columnar
- internal anal sphincter
	- thickened component of circular smooth muscle
	- autonomic nerve control (GVA)
### Anus
- stratified squamous
- external sphincter
	- voluntary skeletal muscle
	- controlled by the pudendal nerve
