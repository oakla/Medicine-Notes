## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes
The gut tube starts at the oesophagus and ends with the anus. The common muscular pattern along the tube is longitudinal muscle in the outer layer, circular (or helical) muscle in the inner layer 
## Oesophagus
- stratified squamous epithelium
- skeletal muscles in the upper oesophagus
- smooth muscle in the lower oesophagus
- glands in mucosa and larger glands in the submucosa
## Stomach
From hereon in, the epithelium is all simple columnar epithelium (until we get to the anus). 

Secretes acid and enzymes (which protects against pathogens) and mucous (which protects against the acid)

Glands in the tube wall of the stomach are partially protected by **secretory sheaths**, which are like tunnels that glands hide in away from stomach acid. More distall sheaths are typically longer than more proximal ones.
