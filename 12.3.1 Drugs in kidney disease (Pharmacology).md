# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
- Describe the role and mechanism of drug clearance in the kidneys
	- Filtration, active secretion and metabolism
	- Relate this to changes in renal failure and augmented renal clearance
- Recognise how changes in renal clearance affect drug exposure
	- Impact on loading dose and maintenance dose
- Outline how renal function may be assessed and be able to compare the different methods and understand the limitations
- Describe the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes that occur with renal failure
- Describe examples of how drug dosing may be altered in renal failure

## My Summary

### What you need to Know
- How is the kidney involved in drug clearance?
- How does renal failure impact this role
- What is the impact of changes in renal clearance on 
	- loading dose
	- maintenance dose
- how to assess renal function - compare methods
- PK and PD changes with renal failure
- Examples of drug dosing alterations in renal failure

### Intro
Changes in kidney function can affect pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK). 

Variations in kindey function can affect parmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 
PK:
- absorption
	- increased gastric pH can interact with medications
- distribution
	- 'fluid overload' can dilute a drug
- metabolism
	- some drugs are metabolised by the kidneys
- excretion
	- drugs not being excreted
PD:
- Drugs that act on kidney are commonly susceptible
- ACE inhibitors can lead to hyperkaelaemia

### Clearance rate
Drug clearance is a function of the kidneys and liver. To compensate for this, when considering drugs that are cleared renally, Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) should be measured or estimated and dosing adjusted accordingly.

Two categories of change in clearance rate are 
- [[Renal Failure]] (RF) => decreased clearance
- [[Augmented Renal Clearance]] (ACR) => increased clearance and easy to underestimate

Changes in drug clearance can impact drug half-life and thus affect time to reach steady-state levels. Typically RF would decrease drug clearance. Half the clearance => twice the half-life. An increase in half-life can be conmpensated for by decreasing dose amount or frequency 

Some drugs can take a long time to reach 'steady state' in the patient. Sometimes an initial 'loading' dose is given to get there sooner. Renal clearance does not impact the appropriate loading dose

Patients with ARC have increased renal perfusion and thus increased GFR. This results in higher clearance and puts them at risk of being underdosed.
### Assessing renal clearance
To help with dosing, we can estimate or measure GFR as a way to estimate renal clearance

Ways to assess GFR
1. Spot urine test (estimate)
2. Serum based eGFR (estimate)
	1. measure serum concentration of creatinine
	2. use formula (with age, sex & weight) to calculate eGFR
3. 24 urine analysis (direct measurement)
4. nuclear medicine scans (direct measurement)

Creatatine levels are impacted by many confounders especially patient muscle mass.

Instead of creatinine, other biomarkers can be used such as inulin or cystatin C. 
- **Inulin** must be administered to the patient intervenously and then excretion measured over time. 
- **Cystatin C** is more expensive to measure. Cystatin C is not as affected by muscle mass but has other confounders
## Examples
### Filtering
#### [[Enoxaparin]] (Clexane)
- primarily renally cleared
- increased half-life in KF because of reduced excretion
#### Vancomycin
- predominantly renally cleared
- same loading dose but different maintenance dose
### Metabolism
#### Exogenous insulins
- exogenous insulin is more reliant on renal clearance than indogenous insulin
	- therefore lower doses are required in renal impairment
### Pharmacodynamic changes
#### [[Frusemide]]
- a diuretic that acts on pumps of the LoH
- in RF, the effective dose for a diuretic response is increased
### Drug-drug Interactions
Renal function also affects drug interactions e.g. Cephazolin and Probenecid
- Probenecid inhibits transports in the kidney that would otherwise secrete cephazolin

## Renal Clearnance impact on Drugs
**Underlying assumption**: renal clearance ~ function (tight correlation) 

different drugs have different renal clearance rates
### Functions

Usually we just consider GFR to guess/measure renal clearance, but there are others
- **Filtration** (GFR) is affected by many things (e.g. molecular size, chemical properties of the drug)
- Active secretion
- Reabsoprtion
- Metabolism - limited but most significant with insulin

### Management
Dosing drugs + factoring in renal clearance of those drugs
half-life ~ 1/clearance
increase half-life => longer to reach steady state

solution: half dose or frequency of maintenance dose

loading dose not affected by renal clearance

## Measuring Renal Function




Renal Clearance (RC) and Dose

RC ~ renal function


## Assessing Renal Function


direct measurement
- 
estimations
- f(age, weight) => Estimated Creatinine Clearance (eCrCl)

Creatinine limitations
- takes time to reach steady state => slow to reflect changes in renal function
- many sources of variability
	- confindence interval increases as the estimate increases

eGFR units mL/min per 1.73 m^2
- volume / time / surface area


Measuring GFR
- 3 ways (in lecture)
	- Other biochemical markers
		- Cystatin C
			- less influenced by muscle mass
			- still influenced by other factors
	- 24 hour urine collection - lots of effort, possible to miss some collection
	- Nuclear medicine scans


Renal Disease can increase GFR => increased dosage required

## Examples

Vancomycin

Exogenous Insulin
- much lower dose required with impaired renal fucntion
