- Upper GI disease
	- some elements of the surgical sieve more key than others
	- can be mechanical or chemical
	- stomach contents not being they're supposed to be. e.g.:
		1. slightly bad in the duodenum
		2. worse in oesophagus
		3. very bad in lungs
- Haematemesis
	- two types
		- bright red
		- looks like coffee grounds
	- many many potential causes
	- **important presenting problem** (however not very specific) - consider as a medical emergency
- GI tumours
	- carcinoma is most common (unsurprisingly)
	- polyps
		- "a descriptive term"
- Oesophagus
	- not much to know but know it well
	- several core conditions
		- Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (including hiatal hernia) (GORD)
		- **Oesophagitis** (reflux, viral, fungal, and eosinophilic oesophagitis)
		- **Barrett's oesophagus**/metaplasia
		- Carcinoma of the oesophagus
		- **Oesophageal varices**
Oesophageal varices
- tortuous **dilated veins** caused by portal hypertension
- veins become sensitive to mechanicl damage
GORD
- "reflux symptoms thgat occur at least once a week"
- can be exacerbated by specific food types
- can come with asthma
- *not the same as gastritis*
- pretty common (5-10% adults)
- also common in children esp babies (and esp early babies (problems with muscle tone))
- usually no biggie, but serious when there are complications
- can ~~be caused by~~ involve(?) prolapse of stomach through diaphragm into mediastinum
- causes general:
	- shift of homeostasis: anything that makes the stomach bigger, slower (emptying), more acidic
	- transient sphincter relaxation
	- hiatal hernia (two types)
- reflux can lead to barrett's
- causes inflammaiton
Barrett's Oesophagus
- oesophagus metaplasia => goblets cells ala duodnum
- not dyplastic but can lead to dyplasia
*other* causes of oesophagitis
- viral/fungal infection => 'ulcerative oesophagitis'
important notes: 
- many of the features to not correlate 1:1 (e.g. hernia without reflux)
Severe dysplasia
- oesophageal cancer
	- very aggressive, lots of lymph nodes to get into in that area
	- presents at late stage usually
	- SCC vs Adenocarcinoma
		- SCC 
			- much more common in asia and africa
			- increased risk from very hot dirnks, alcohol, smoking
			- middle third usually
		- **Adenocarcinoma** 
			- much more common in Australia (and other developed countries)
			- more common in men
