Key Concepts/Focus
- [[coronary heart disease]]
- [[atherosclerosis]]
- [[ischaemia]]
- [[myocardial infarction]]
- [[heart failure]]
- [[acute coronary syndrome]]
- [[troponin]]


Atherosclerosis
big causes:
- LDL particles
- turbulent flow

Coronary Circulation
- lots of turbulent flow


Detecting M infarction/injury by blood testing
- cardiac troponin


## Immunoassay
- use 99th percentile and concentration threshold
### Troponin
Troponin antibodies used
- captures cTn molecules (e.g. TnI)
then another one
chem reaction releases light
light correlated with conc

#### 99th Percentile
test comes with known conc calibrators => allows 99th percentile comparison

even in a health population, conc > 99th percentile may appear
- only one component => non-definitive
- 
#### Where do calibrators come from
- based on primary calibrator reference material
- deviations appear downstream in secondary calibrators and individual company procedures. leads to variations
	- cut-offs should be different for different labs/companies
	- should get test from same company for comparison purposes


### Macrotroponin
- formed from endogenous antibodies + troponin
- longer half life => higher conc
	- can confound results

## Heart Failure
lots of causes

Compensatory mechanisms
- frank-starling
- cardiac hypertrophy
	- maladaptive in long-term - narrows LV lumen
- Neurohormonal activation
	- RAAS (bad in long term)
	- Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), **B-type or brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)**

### BNP
does good things
measure can contribute to diagnosis
made and release in response to stretch (from heart)
NT-proBNP is the inactive 'cleavage product'

#### Sacubitril and BNP
Sacubitril can mess with the result
