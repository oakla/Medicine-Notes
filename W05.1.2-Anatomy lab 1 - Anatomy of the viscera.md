# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
1. Identify and describe the **difference between parietal and visceral pleura/peritoneum**, and where you would find each of them.
2. Understand the shape of the diaphragm, its attachments, and components, identifying the major structures that pass through the diaphragm and describe the component of the diaphragm each structure is passing through.
3. Identify the features of the lungs, including contralateral differences.
4. Identify and understand the anatomy of the heart as presented here.
5. Understand the divisions of the mediastinum and identify structures that pass through the posterior mediastinum.
6. Identify and describe the different planes and regions of the abdominal cavity, including associated surface anatomy, and which organs you would expect to find in each region.
7. Identify the specific anatomical features for each abdominal organ to the level indicated in the text of this laboratory manual.
8. Understand the anatomical relations of all abdominal organs (how each organ sits relative to the others).
9. Understand the relevance of paired and unpaired primary divisions of the abdominal aorta, and be able to identify them in cadaver specimens as well as in histology slides of the developing human.

### Drawing and correlation exercise
Blood vessels to the **three-paired adrenal, renal and gonadal arteries** all come directly off the lateral sides of the abdominal aorta. (variable between specimens) 

Blood vessels to the **liver, pancreas, stomach, and spleen** can all be traced back to the **coeliac trunk**, the first of three unpaired arteries found diverging from the anterior surface of the abdominal aorta. 

The blood supply of the entire small intestine, ascending colon and most of the transverse colon, can be traced back to the second unpaired artery of the aorta – this artery is named **the superior mesenteric artery**. The third unpaired branch of the aorta, **the inferior mesenteric artery**, supplies the rest of the gut tube. The abdominal aorta finally bifurcates into the left and right common iliac arteries at the level of L4. 

Using this information, draw a schematic diagram of the arterial braches of the abdominal aorta

### Clozures
#### Levels
The abdominal aorta finally bifurcates into the left and right common iliac arteries at the level of L4

#### small intestines
The small intestines are attached to the posterior body wall by a large piece of  tissue, which contains many blood vessels. What is this tissue called?  
A mesentery  
Now see how it is continuous with the inner lining of the abdominal wall. What is this lining called?  
Peritoneum

#### The liver
The falciform ligament is a peritoneal fold that separates the liver into right and left lobe.
The ligamentum teres hepatis (fibrous cord) travels along the free edge of the falciform ligament and attaches the liver to the anterior abdominal wall. 
The human liver can be divided into four anatomical lobes: the right lobe, the left lobe, the caudate lobe, and the quadrate lobe. The caudate and quadrate lobes are smaller and located on the visceral surface of the right lobe, with the caudate being more superior.
