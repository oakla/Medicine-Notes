Spermatogenesis
1. primordial germ cells (embryonic)
2. spermatogonia
3. spermatocytes
4. spermatids
5. spermatozoa (fully mature sperm)

Spermatogenesis
1. During gestation
	1. primordial germ cells (embryonic) migrate to testes and become spermatogonia
2. At puberty, 
	1. Spermatogonia mature and proliferate (mitosis)
	2. Spermatogonia differentiate to spermatocytes 
	3. 1° spermatocyte => 2x 2° spermatocytes (Meiosis I)
	4. 2° spermatocytes => 4x spermatids (Meiosis II)
	5. Spermatids differentiate into mature spermatozoa
