# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
- Explain how **pregnancy alters drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics**.
- Identify ==drugs that require dose adjustment or avoidance== during pregnancy.
- Describe mechanisms and timing of ==teratogenicity== and fetal drug exposure
- Evaluate the safety of ==medications in lactation== using Relative Infant Dose (RID).
- Apply regulatory and ethical principles to medication decisions in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes
## pregnancy alters drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics
How?
Changes in the body of a pregnant women result in changes to pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics in pregnant women 

### Factors that have the most impact on drug pharmacokinetics (PK)
- Changes in heart function
- Changes in lung function

#### Absorption
- Gastrointestinal changes:
	- Changes in gastrointestinal (GI) motility slow drug absorption due to progesterone-induced relaxation of smooth muscles.
	- Poor oral drug compliance due to nausea & vomiting in early pregnancy - Increased gastric pH may alter the absorption of certain drugs (e.g., decreased absorption of weak acids).
- Lower dose requirements for transdermal drugs due to higher skin blood flow, resulting in more free drug unless highly protein bound.
#### Distribution
- Changes in body fluid volume
	- Increased plasma volume (up to 50%) results in the dilution of water-soluble drugs.
- Reduced plasma protein binding (e.g., albumin) means more free (active) drug in circulation.
- Enhanced tissue perfusion and fat stores increase distribution of lipophilic drugs.
#### Metabolism/Elimination
- Hepatic changes
	- Hepatic enzymes changes. Some increase in activity and some decrease in activity, leading to changes in speed of metabolism
	- Changes in liver blood flow also influence drug metabolism.
- Alterations in kidney function - Increase filtration rate & kidney blood flow
	- Increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by up to 50% accelerates renal excretion of drugs.
	- Higher dose requirements (antidepressants, anticonvulsants, lithium, penicillin, heparins) due increased clearance.

## Clinical
- Pregnancy PK changes peak in 3rd trimester. Dose escalation is often needed, but afterwards postpartum dose reduction is essential
- Modern modeling tools enhance individualized dosing during pregnancy
## Drugs that require dose adjustment or avoidance during pregnancy

Drug classes that commonly require dose adjustments during pregnancy
- Anticonvulsants
- Antidepressants
- Anticoagulants

Specific drugs
- Sertraline
	- Indication: depression
	- PK change: increase in CYP2C19 activity which leads to increase metabolism and reduced plasma concentrations
	- Dosing adjustment: May need increased dose
- Metformin
	- Indication: T2DM, PCOS
	- PK change: increase renal clearance
	- Dosing adjustment: May need increased dose


Teratogens

- Teratogens effect categories:
	- physical malformation
	- functional defects
	- growth retardation
	- fetal demise
- Example common teratogens
	- isotretinoin
	- ACE inhibitors
	- antiepileptics
- Exposure timings include pre-implantation (0-2 weeks), embryonic (2-8 weeks), and fetal (9 weeks to birth).
- Teratogenic effects increase with dose beyond a certain threshold.
- Mechanisms of teratogenicity include 
	- disruption of cellular signaling
	- DNA damage
	- oxidative stress
	- impaired angiogenesis
	- endocrine disruption
==- Drug classifications (discussed later in lecture) highlight the importance of drug safety during pregnancy.==


Pregnancy ADME & PK: Pregnancy induces physiological
changes affecting drug absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and excretion. Increased renal clearance,
altered hepatic metabolism, and expanded blood
volume may require dose adjustments.
Pharmacogenetics in Pregnancy: Genetic variations in
drug-metabolizing enzymes can influence drug
processing during pregnancy. Understanding these
genetic variations can help tailor pharmacotherapy for
optimal outcomes.
Teratogenicity: Teratogens cause congenital
malformations or developmental abnormalities during
pregnancy. The most sensitive period is during
organogenesis, especially in the first trimester.
Placental Drug Transfer: Drugs can cross the placenta,
causing therapeutic effects or adverse outcomes.
Factors influencing placental transfer include molecular
weight, lipophilicity, ionization, and protein binding.
Fetal Drug Exposure: Fetus' immature liver enzymes,
kidney function, and developing blood-brain barrier
can affect drug metabolism and clearance. Drugs
crossing the placenta can accumulate in the fetus,
potentially leading to toxicity or therapeutic effects.
Medication Use in Lactation: Safety considerations for
medication use during breastfeeding depend on
factors like half-life, milk production effects, and infant
impact.
Lactation and Drug Transfer into Breast Milk:
Mechanism depends on molecular weight, lipid
solubility, and pH of the drug and milk.
Classification Rules Categorisation System
(A, B1-3, C, D, X) - 'A' is safest

Summary

Some drugs are not appropriate for pregnancy
Some drug does neeed to be adjusted
ADME of many (most?)drugs will change during pregnancy
Causes of changes
- absorption - some GIT changes
- increase weight and/or changes in proteins in blood will affect **distribution**
- renal changes affect **execretion** and/or metabolism
