# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
- Explain how pregnancy alters drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics.
- Identify drugs that require dose adjustment or avoidance during pregnancy.
- Describe mechanisms and timing of teratogenicity and fetal drug exposure.
- Evaluate the safety of medications in lactation using Relative Infant Dose (RID).
- Apply regulatory and ethical principles to medication decisions in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes
pregnancy alters drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics
How?

Changes in the body of a pregnant women result in changes to pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics in pregnant women

Factors that have the most impact on drug pharmacokinetics (PK)
- Alterations in kidney function - Increase filtration rate & kidney blood flow
- Changes in body fluid volume
	- Increased plasma volume (up to 50%) results in the dilution of water-soluble drugs.
- Changes in heart function
- Changes in lung function
- Gastrointestinal changes:
	- Changes in gastrointestinal (GI) motility slow drug absorption due to progesterone-induced relaxation of smooth muscles.
	- Poor oral drug compliance due to nausea & vomiting in early pregnancy - Increased gastric pH may alter the absorption of certain drugs (e.g., decreased absorption of weak acids).
- Reduced plasma protein binding (e.g., albumin) means more free (active) drug in circulation.
- Hepatic changes
	- Hepatic enzymes changes. Some increase in activity and some decrease in activity, leading to changes in speed of metabolism
	- Changes in liver blood flow also influence drug metabolism.
- Enhanced tissue perfusion and fat stores increase distribution of lipophilic drugs.
- Increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by up to 50%
accelerates renal excretion of drugs.
• Higher dose requirements (antidepressants, anticonvulsants,
lithium, penicillin, heparins) due increased clearance.
• Lower dose requirements for transdermal drugs due to higher skin
blood flow, resulting in more free drug unless highly protein
bound.
• Modern PK and PBPK modeling tools enhance individualized
dosing during pregnancy and help anticipate the impact of
enzyme and transporter changes on drug exposure.

Drug classes that commonly require dose adjustments during pregnancy
- Anticonvulsants
- Antidepressants
- Anticoagulants

Teratogenic effects

Some drugs are not appropriate for pregnancy
Some drug does neeed to be adjusted
ADME of many (most?)drugs will change during pregnancy
Causes of changes
- absorption - some GIT changes
- increase weight and/or changes in proteins in blood will affect **distribution**
- renal changes affect **execretion** and/or metabolism
