# 🩺 Kidney Function II — Key Concepts

## Tubular Reabsorption

* **Highly selective.**

  * 100% glucose, nearly all amino acids.
  * \~99% salts and water.
  * Wastes (creatinine, much urea) not reabsorbed.
* **Mechanisms:**

  * **Active transport:** Na+, H+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+.
  * **Secondary active transport:** glucose, amino acids, Cl−, H+ (coupled with Na+).
  * **Pinocytosis:** small proteins (<50 kDa).
  * **Passive transport:** Cl−, HCO3−, urea, water.
  * **Osmosis:** water follows Na+ (aquaporins, solvent drag).

## Segmental Nephron Function

* **Proximal Tubule (PCT):**

  * Reabsorbs \~65% NaCl & water, 100% glucose & amino acids.
  * Major site of secretion (H+, organic acids/bases, drugs).
  * Brush border → ↑ surface area; loaded with transporters.
* **Loop of Henle (LoH):**

  * Descending: permeable to water, little ion transport.
  * Ascending (especially thick limb): impermeable to water, active Na+K+2Cl− transport; lumen +ve drives Ca2+/Mg2+ reabsorption.
* **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT):**

  * Early: “diluting segment” (NaCl reabsorption, impermeable to water).
  * Late + Cortical Collecting Tubule:

    * **Principal cells:** reabsorb Na+, secrete K+ (aldosterone sensitive).
    * **Intercalated cells:** secrete H+, reabsorb HCO3− & K+.
* **Collecting Ducts:**

  * **Cortical CD:** ADH makes it water permeable; impermeable to urea.
  * **Medullary CD:** permeable to urea (with ADH), contributing to medullary gradient.

## Producing Dilute vs Concentrated Urine

* **Dilute urine (<50 mOsm/L):**

  * Solute reabsorption without water in DCT/CD (ADH absent).
* **Concentrated urine (up to 1200–1400 mOsm/L in humans):**

  * Requires:

    * ADH (↑ aquaporins in DCT/CD).
    * Hyperosmotic medullary interstitium.
    * Countercurrent multiplier (Loop of Henle) + exchanger (vasa recta).
    * Urea recycling (contributes \~40–50% of medullary osmolarity).

## Countercurrent Systems

* **Countercurrent Multiplier (Loop of Henle):**

  * Descending limb: water leaves, fluid equilibrates with interstitium.
  * Thick ascending limb: active Na+K+2Cl− transport, impermeable to water → dilutes tubular fluid, concentrates interstitium.
* **Urea Recirculation:**

  * With ADH, urea diffuses from inner medullary CD → interstitium → LoH → back to CD.
  * Maintains high osmolarity in medulla.
* **Vasa Recta (Countercurrent Exchanger):**

  * Low medullary blood flow (<5% RBF).
  * Slow, countercurrent exchange prevents washout of medullary gradient.

## Key Regulatory Hormones

* **Aldosterone:** ↑ Na+ reabsorption, ↑ K+ secretion (principal cells).
* **ADH:** ↑ water reabsorption (DCT/CD aquaporins), ↑ urea permeability (inner medullary CD).
* **ANP:** promotes natriuresis (not emphasised here, but ties to lecture I).
