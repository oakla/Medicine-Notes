## Learning Objectives
1. [[#Understand that mutations drive cancerous transformation, and that the immune system can see these alterations]]
2. [[#Define the important cells of the immune system and their pro- or anti- tumourigenic effects]]
3. [[#Appreciate how an understanding of the tumour-immune microenvironment can be critical for patient stratification]]
4. [[#Explain the major forms of cancer immunotherapy approved for use in clinical oncology.]]
### Understand that mutations drive cancerous transformation, and that the immune system can see these alterations
6 hallmarks of cancer
- self signalling for growth
- non-responsive to growth suppression
- evading cell death
- angiogenesis
- replicative imortallity
- activating invasion and metastasis

Emerging Hallmarks
- deregulating energetics
- avoiding immune destruction
Enabling Characteristics
- genome instability
- 
### Define the important cells of the immune system and their pro- or anti- tumourigenic effects
anti-tumour
- Dendritic cells - APC to T Cells
- NK cells 
	- can kill cells that down reg HLA (human MHC) expression - C Cells do this
	- communicate with other innate immune cells
- CD4 T cells
	- can be both C supportive or anti tumour
- CD8 T Cells
	- kill C cells after APC activation
potentially pro-tumour cells
- macrophages and monocytes
	- manipulated to supress immune system
- CD4 T cells
	- can be both C supportive or anti tumour

### Appreciate how an understanding of the tumour-immune microenvironment can be critical for patient stratification


### Explain the major forms of cancer immunotherapy approved for use in clinical oncology.


## Major Concepts
Immunosurveillance of Cancer

Immunoediting
- elimination, editing, escape

Immunosuppression
• Recruiting suppressive cells
• Release of cytokines and growth factors
• Expression of checkpoint ligands
• Downregulation of HLA or antigen
• Metabolic reprogramming and tumour hypoxia

Clinical immuno-oncology
This includes:
• Immunoscore to determine ‘hot or ‘cold’ tumours
• Prognostic markers such as CD8 T cell infiltration
• Understanding of immunosuppressive factors or
• Immune evasion mechanisms present in the TME

Cancer Immunotherapy
Monoclonal Antibodies
- can mediate killing of C through several mechanisms
	- disrupting signalling needed for tumour survival e.g. 
		- [[Epidermal Growth Factor|EGFR]]
		- [[Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor|Vegf]]
	- marking for destruction (Tumour heterogeneity remains a problem for this approach)
Immune Checkpoint Blockade - anti anti T Cell drugs
- Ipilimumab
- Nivolumab
Immune adjuvants
Adoptive cell therapies
- breed patient's own t cells outside the body
- Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs)
	- can be armoured!
Cytokines
- toxicity has been a problem :(
