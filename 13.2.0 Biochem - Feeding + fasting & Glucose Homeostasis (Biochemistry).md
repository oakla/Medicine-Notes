# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts

- metabolism of glucose and glycogen
- glycogen storage
- 'importance' of glucose homeostasis in **key organs** (what happens if not homeostatic?)
- blood \[glucose\]
	- range
	- hormones (*insulin*, *glucagon*, adrenaline)
	- importance
- key enzymes (and how they are impacted by hormones)
- pathways

# Notes

\[gluc] = 5mmol (range of 3 - 8 in health)

glycogen glucose pyruvate
glycogenesis / glycogenolysis
glycolysis / gluconeogenesis

Liver 
- hexokinase traps glucose (and other 6 carbon sugars) inside cell
	- Phosphorylation(glucose) => **Glucose 6-P** -> glucose trapped in liver
	- phosphorylates and adds/changes charge
	- Liver hexokinase IV (glucokinase) can still work in the presence of lots of its product
- 5 things that happen to **glucose 6-P** in the liver (S6)
	1. => glucose => blood
	2. => liver *==glycogen==* stores
	3. => pyruvate => AcCoA => ATP for liver
	4. => pyruvate => AcCoA => FA => TG
	5. [[Pentose Phosphate Pathway|PPP]] makes NADPH
		1. activated when we've got lots of glucose to make NADPH
		2. NADPH is needed in anabolism
		3. PPP also makes Ribose-5-phosphate (important nucleotide) 

Phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1)
- PFK-1 adds phospate to fructose 6-P to create fructose 1,6-bisP 
- PFK-1 is a key enzyme in glycolysis
- insulin indirectly activates PFK-1
	- More directly, insulin drives the creation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP) by activating Phosphofructokinase-2
	- F2,6BP then stimulates PFK-1, and thus glycolysis
- in summary: **insulin** activates **phosphofructokinase-2** which creates **fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP)**. F2,6BP stimulates Phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1). PFK-1 drives **glycolysis**
Fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase
- drives gluconeogenesis
- does the opposite to PFK-1
- is inhibited by F2,6BP
