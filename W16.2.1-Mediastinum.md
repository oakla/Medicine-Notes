# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
- Identify and describe the different types of vessels, relating their structure to their function, including special characteristic of trunk specific vasculature
- Identify the vessels that have been presented in this lecture (written into the slides)
- Describe the pattern/flow/pathway of arterial blood supply and venous drainage for structures derived from
	- Splanchnopleure
	- Intermediate mesoderm
	- Somatopleure
## Outline/Sections
Blood vessels 
- what are they made of?
- how are they structured?

## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes

## Overview origins of the IVC
The inferior vena cava originates from parts of several embryological venous systems. Dividing the IVC into segments, its origins, superior to inferior are:  
1. right viteline vein
	- hepatic portion of the IVC
	- receives hepatic veins
	- most proximal to the heart
2. an anastomes between subcardinal and viteline systems (the subcardinohepatic anastomoses)
3. the right branch of the subcardinal system
	- renal portion of the IVC
	- drains the 'paired organs'; kidneys, adrenals, gonads
4. the posterior portion of the right 'proper/primary' cardinal system (aka right sacral cardinal vein)
	- drain blood from the lower limbs

## Sinus Venosus
At about 24 days GA, the sinus venosus has 3 pairs of veins draining into it:
- left and right common cardinal veins
- left and right umbilical veins
- left and right viteline veins

Of the veins draining to the sinus venosus during development (left and right common cardinal, umbilical, and viteline), only 2 direct connections persist into adulthood; the right common cardinal and the right viteline.

The right common cardinal and one of its branches become the superior vena cava
The right viteline becomes the inferior vena cava

## Anterior cardinal anastomis and the LBCV

In fetal development, the left anterior cardinal vein loses its inferior portion, and thus loses its connection to the left horn of the sinus venosus (part of the future coronary sinus). Drainage is instead routed over to the right anterior cardianl vein (which becomes the superior vena cava) via an anastomosis which becomes the transverse portion of the left brachio cephalic vein (LBCV). 

This is why the LBCV is longer than the RBCV

## Viteline
the hepatic portion of the IVC is derived from the right viteline system
