# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
- Identify and describe the different types of vessels, relating their structure to their function, including special characteristic of trunk specific vasculature
- Identify the vessels that have been presented in this lecture (written into the slides)
- Describe the pattern/flow/pathway of arterial blood supply and venous drainage for structures derived from
	- Splanchnopleure
	- Intermediate mesoderm
	- Somatopleure
## Outline/Sections
Blood vessels 
- what are they made of?
- how are they structured?

## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes

Of the veins draining to the sinus venosus during development (left and right common cardinal, umbilical, and viteline), only 2 direct connections persists into adulthood; the right common cardinal and the right viteline.

The right common cardinal and one of its branches become the superior vena cava

The right viteline becomes the inferior vena cava

## Anterior cardinal anastomis and the LBCV

In fetal development, the left anterior cardinal vein loses its inferior portion, and thus loses its connection to the left horn of the sinus venosus (part of the future coronary sinus). Drainage is instead routed over to the right anterior cardianl vein (which becomes the superior vena cava) via an anastomosis which becomes the transverse portion of the left brachio cephalic vein (LBCV). 

This is why the LBCV is longer than the RBCV
