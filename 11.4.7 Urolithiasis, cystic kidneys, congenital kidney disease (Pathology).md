# üßæ Lecture Summary: Urolithiasis, Obstruction & Congenital Malformations

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Recognize **major congenital anomalies** of kidney/urinary tract & their complications.
    
- Outline **cystic renal diseases**: causes, pathogenesis, clinical features.
    
- Classify **urinary tract obstruction**: causes, features, complications.
    
- Explain how obstruction ‚Üí **kidney injury**.

## üë∂ Congenital Malformations

- ~10% of people born with significant anomaly.
    
- 20% of childhood renal failure = dysplasia/hypoplasia.
    
- 10% of chronic renal failure = ADPKD.
    

**Types:**

- Agenesis (uni/bilateral)
    
- Hypoplasia
    
- Ectopic kidney
    
- Horseshoe kidney
    
- Duplex collecting system
    
- Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR)
    
- Posterior urethral valves
    

**Key Examples:**

- **Bilateral agenesis (Potter‚Äôs syndrome):** oligohydramnios, hypoplastic lungs, fatal.
    
- **Unilateral agenesis:** often silent; contralateral hypertrophy.
    
- **Ectopic kidney:** pelvic, tortuous ureter ‚Üí obstruction/infection.
    
- **Horseshoe kidney:** fusion across midline; trapped at IMA; ‚Üë infections, stones, cancer.
    
- **VUR:** faulty ureterovesical junction ‚Üí reflux, scarring.
    
- **Posterior urethral valves (males):** obstructive membrane ‚Üí neonatal obstruction, oligohydramnios, infections.

## ü´ß Cystic Renal Disease

**Spectrum:**

- Simple renal cysts (common >50y, usually benign).
    
- Cystic renal dysplasia (multicystic dysplastic kidney): irregular cysts, abnormal tissue; mass in infants.
    
- Polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD, ARPKD).
    
- Medullary diseases (e.g. nephronophthisis, sponge kidney).
    
- Syndromic cysts (e.g. tuberous sclerosis).
    

**Key Disorders:**

- **ADPKD**
    
    - Common (1:500), 10% ESRF patients.
        
    - Genes: PKD1, PKD2, PKD3 ‚Üí polycystins (cilia proteins).
        
    - Bilateral massive kidneys; cysts form in utero, expand with age.
        
    - Presentation: 30s‚Äì50s ‚Üí flank pain, haematuria, HTN.
        
    - Associations: liver/pancreas cysts, berry aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse.
        
- **ARPKD**
    
    - Rare (1:20,000), infancy/childhood.
        
    - Gene: PKHD1 ‚Üí fibrocystin.
        
    - Smooth kidneys, radially oriented cysts (dilated collecting ducts).
        
    - Associated: liver cysts, fibrosis, portal HTN.
        
    - Severe cases: oligohydramnios, stillbirth.

## üö´ Urinary Tract Obstruction

**Definition:** Blocked urine flow ‚Üí ‚Üë pressure, dilation, injury.

**Types:**

- Acute/chronic, partial/complete, uni/bilateral, intrinsic/extrinsic.
    

**Causes:**

- Congenital (e.g. PUVs)
    
- Stones
    
- BPH
    
- Tumours (prostate, bladder, lymph nodes)
    
- Inflammation, clots, papillary slough
    
- Pregnancy, uterine prolapse
    
- Functional (neurogenic)
    

**Effects:**

- Hydronephrosis (dilated renal pelvis/calyces).
    
- Kidney enlargement, function loss (initially reversible).
    
- Thickened bladder wall.
    
- ‚Üë risk infection & stones.

## üíé Urolithiasis (Stones)

- Common; peak onset 20‚Äì30y; M > F; strong recurrence risk.
    
- Often familial.
    
- Usually form in **renal pelvis**.
    

**Types:**

1. **Calcium oxalate/phosphate** (most common).
    
2. **Uric acid** (radiolucent).
    
3. **Struvite** (magnesium ammonium phosphate, ‚Äústaghorn‚Äù stones after Proteus/Klebsiella infection).
    
4. **Cystine, xanthine, drug-related**.
    

**Risk Factors:**

- Dehydration
    
- Supersaturation (pH, solute concentration, bacterial activity)
    
- Metabolic: hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hyperuricaemia
    
- Diet: oxalate foods (rhubarb, spinach, nuts, soy, chocolate, beer), purine-rich foods (red meat, shellfish).
    
- Obesity, diabetes
    

**Complications:**

- Silent/incidental.
    
- Pain & obstruction (renal colic).
    
- Ulceration, haematuria.
    
- Infection.
    

**Renal colic:**

- Severe flank ‚Üí groin pain, ‚Äú10/10‚Äù, often constant.
    
- Associated with haematuria, urgency, sweating, nausea, vomiting.

## üìå Take-home Summary

- Congenital anomalies are common and clinically significant.
    
- Wide variety of cystic renal diseases; **ADPKD and ARPKD** are key.
    
- **Urinary obstruction** can occur at any level, often secondary to stones.
    
- **Urolithiasis** = recurrent, painful, and with major complications.

Would you like me to **reformat these notes into an Anki-friendly table (Q/A/hint/extra)** for active recall, or would you prefer me to **make them more visual** (e.g. concept map / diagram style notes)?
