- Outline some common occupational exposures that can lead to lung disease?
- 
- Outline and briefly describe the various occupational lung diseases. Examples include - Asbestosis, Malignant Mesothelioma, Occupational Asthma, Silicosis, Coal workers' Pneumoconiosis, Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Occupational lung cancer?


## Common occupational exposures
- asbestos
- silica
- wood dust
- diesel

- Asbestosis, 
- Malignant Mesothelioma, 
- Occupational Asthma, 
- Silicosis, 
- Coal workers' Pneumoconiosis, 
- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, 
- Occupational lung cancer


# Obstructive and Restrictive Lung Diseases

**Obstructive lung diseases** involve obstructed air flow, which impairs expiration more than inspiration. 
**Restrictive lung disease** involves reduced expansion +/- reduced recoil, leading to decreased total lung capacity and decreased FVC.

## Comparrison
### Recoil
Recoil (ability of tissue to return to it's original shape) is a factor in *some* restrictive lung diseases (RLD) **and** *some* obstrictive lung diseases (OLD). In emphysema (an OLD), alveolar walls have been damaged or destroyed which impairs the airways ability to stay open under pressure, leading to air trapping
### Air Trapping
Air trapping occurs in OLDs due to airway collapse during expiration. The cause of airway collapse can differ; loss of alvelor walls and elastin fibres in emphysema, and mucus plugging in chronic bronchitis

### Lung Function Test (spirometry)

| Measure             | Obstructive Disorders | Restrictive Disorders |     |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --- |
| FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC | Decreased             | Normal or Increased   |     |
| FEV<sub>1</sub>     | Decreased             | Normal or Increased   |     |
| FVC                 | Decreased or Normal   | Decreased             |     |
| TLC                 | Increased or Normal   | Decreased             |     |
| RV                  | Normal or Increased   | Decreased             |     |


## Obstructive Lung Disease

### COPD
- a spectrum of diseases including chronic bronchitis and ephysema
- Chronic bronchitis 
	- results in high CO2 retention
	- involves cough with lots of sputum
- Emphysema
	- chest is hyper inflated = "barrell chested"
	- PP of oxygen in lungs can be maintained until late stages 
- Mneumonic: Blue bloaters (chronic bronchitis) vs pink puffers (emphysema)

### Emphysema

Abnormal permanent enlargemennt of airspaces distal to terminal bronchiole accompanied by destruction of their walls, without interstitial fibrosis.
