## Thrombosis
### definition
- an intravacular blood clot. i.e. a platelet plug containing trapped bloodcells (e.g. macrophages)
### aetiology
- 
- endothelial damage 
	- exposing collagen leads to plate activation and then activation of thrombin, which creates a fibrin mesh reinforcing the platelets to form a clot
- turbulent flow
- hypercoaguability (inherited or aquired)
### pathogenesis/pathophysiology
-  can occlude blood vessels at the site of formation, or become a thromboembolis and occulde vessles downstream.
- Common critical sites of thromboembolism are lungs and brain
### epidemiology and risk factors
- risk factors
	- male
	- smoker

### the features of clinical presentation
- silent unless severe
- when critical:
	- chest pain (MI symptoms)
	- stroke
	- breathing difficulties
## Atherosclerosis
### definition
- hardening of the arteries 
### aetiology
- caused by hyperlipidaemia and endothelial damage
### pathogenesis/pathophysiology
- lipids deposited to sites of endothelial damage
- macrophages move to clear damage, and become trapped
- plaques form
### epidemiology and risk factors
- smoking 
- being male
- obesity
- diabetes
- hyperlipidaemia
- family history
- older age
### the features of clinical presentation
- often silent
- hypertension
- MI symptoms in sever cases
## Hypertension
### definition
- persistent high blood pressure
### aetiology
- idopathic
- secondary
	- blood vessel stenosis
	- renal failure
### pathogenesis/pathophysiology
- can lead to thrombosis, atherosclerosis, reduced cardiac output, cardiac hypertrophy, aneurysm
### epidemiology and risk factors
- smoking 
- being male
- obesity
- diabetes
- hyperlipidaemia
- family history
- older age
### the features of clinical presentation
- silent
## Ischaemic vascular disease (cardiac and peripheral)
### definition
- reduced blood to heart or peripheries (hands and feet)
### aetiology
- blood vessel occlusion
- heart failure
- stenosis
- blood vessel damage
- valve dysfunction
### pathogenesis/pathophysiology
- reduced blood flow to tissue causes necrosis which leads to ulcers or cardiac failure
### epidemiology and risk factors
- male
- age
- smoking
- obesity 
- trauma
### the features of clinical presentation
peripheral
- numbness and/or sores on hands and feet
Cardiac
- MI symptoms
- dysnopea
