Diabetes mellitus is characterised by sustained hyperglycaemia

# Type 1 Diabetes
Treatment for T1D 
- lifelong insulin
- lifestyle changes (reduced carb intake)

# Type 2 Diabetes
## Treatment

## Drugs Treatments
T2D treatment drugs are 'hypogylcaemic' (antihyperglycaemic) drugs and insulin. 

The broard categories are:
- Metformin
- Sulfonylureas
- [[#Incretin-Based Therapy|Incretin-Based Therapies]]
	- e.g. GLP1-agonists
- SGLT2 Inhibitors
- α-Glucosidase Inhibitors
- TZDs
- Insulin

1. Metformin
	- is a hypoglycaemic (or antihyperglycemic) drug but does not cause hypoglycaemia
	- first-line drug treatment in T2DM
	- main side effects: GI AEs
2. Sulfonylureas (SUs) 
	- e.g. glicazide
	- historical
	- mechanism: insulin secretagogues, i.e. activate insulin secretion
	- Side Effects & Cautions:
		- risk of hypoglycaemia
		- weight gain
	- used to be often used to complement metformin (now increasingly replaced by incretin-based therapies and SGLT2 inhibitors)
3. [[#Incretin-Based Therapy|Incretin-Based Therapies]]
	- main side effect is nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea
4. SGLT2 Inhibitors
	- new
	- MoA:
		- prevent glucose reabsorption (renal)
	- additional CV and renal benefits
		- reduces Na reabsorption => lower BP
		- reduces weight
5. α-glucosidase inhibitor
	- e.g. acarbose
	- Mechanism:
		- inhibit breakdown of maltose → glucose
		- delay CHO absorption → control post-prandial hyperglycaemia
	- GI effects very common,
	- limited role these days
6. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)
	- increase insulin sensitivity
	- side effects; 
		- weight gain, fluid rention
			- therefore C/I in systematic heart failure
		- increase cardiac events (MI)
	- only for patients unable to tolerate other drugs
7. Insulin
	- last resort - if all other drugs have been tried and HbA1c is still high (>8%)
	- threshold decreases (HbA1C ~7%) if
		- patient is young
		- there is evidence of microvascular disease

### Incretin-Based Therapy
Incretins are hormones released by the gut after a meal that stimulate insulin product, slow down digestion and create feelings of satiety
high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects
1. [[#What is GLP-1|GPL-1]]R agonists
	- examples: semaglutide and liraglutide
	- [[#Incretin-Based Therapy]]
2. DPP-4 inhibitors
	- dapagliflozin
	- incretin-based therapy
3. GLP1R/GIPR dual agonist
#### What is GLP-1?
- GLP-1 stands for glucagon-like peptide-1 
- GLP-1 is an **incretin** (hormone released from the gut after eating that stimulate the pancreas to release insulin, help regulate blood sugar, and slow down digestion)
- GLP-1 signals that food has been eaten and is in the gut (and that blood sugar levels may soon increase). This leads to
	- 'fullness'/satiety 
	- increase insulin release
	- slowed digestion
- There are GLP1 receptors on pancreatic β-cells
- GLP-1 and glucagon share the same precursor protein (proglucagon) but have opposite - (and complementary) effects
## Non-drug Treatment
Bariatric Surgery
- very effective 
- option if BMI > 35

## Treatment Summary
Treatment for T2D - progressive disease, ∴ step-wise ↑ in therapies
1. lifestyle modifications aiming at weight loss
2. hypoglycaemic mono therapy - usually metformin
3. hypoglycaemic multi therapy - metformin + SGLT2i or incretin-based or SUs
4. use of new therapies ↑↑ - also show significant CV & renal function effects
5. if HbA1c levels still indicate poor control then consider insulin prescription

T2D treatment should be individualised treatment according to:
- age
- co-morbidities
- duration of T2D
- motivation
CVD risk factors should also be treated aggresively
Therapeutic adherence is often poor
