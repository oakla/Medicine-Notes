1. layers of cervical fascia and the contents each holds.
2. describe the pathways blood would travel through ...
3. dural folds and their respective dural venous sinuses,
	1. contents of the cavernous sinus, 
	2. the flow of blood through these sinuses, including how they can communicate with the extracranial blood.
4. cranial nerves as they pierce the dura, 
	1. the foramen and spaces each nerve passes through, 
	2. the functions of each nerve.
5. Locate and feel the pulses that are listed in these lab pages.
6. the spaces in which the vessels presented in this lab are found, and if they accompany any specific nerves.



## cervical fascia
contents each holds

- pre-vertebral fascia
	- vertebral column and 
	- its muscles
- carotid sheath surrounds 
	- the carotid artery, 
	- internal jugular vein, and 
	- vagus nerve
- Visceral fascia surrounds the 
	- pharynx,
	- larynx,
	- trachea, 
	- oesophagus, and 
	- thyroid gland
- The deep/investing fascial of the neck surrounds the 
	- whole neck and 
	- contains the 
		- sternomastoid and
		- trapezius muscles
