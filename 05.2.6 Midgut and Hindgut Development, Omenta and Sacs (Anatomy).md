Mid gut and hindgut rotation during development
1. Looking in an anterior-posterior direction, the primitive midgut rotates anti-clockwise around superior mesenteric artery
2. The caudal portion of the midgut is lifted above the superior mesenteric artery, drive by elongation of the hindgut


## Zygosis of the hindgut
- Sections of the hindgut mesentery adhere/fuse to the posterior body wall, because those sections of hindgut, along with their mesentries, are pushed into place by other organs. 
- The descending colon is pushed to the right by jegenum
	- creates the quadrangular fusion
- The caecum is pushed down to the right by growth of the ascending colon, and competition for space with the liver and ileum
