## Global High-Yield Concepts (read this first)

* **Three histologic patterns** underpin most liver disease: **hepatitis (inflammation), steatosis, cholestasis**. There can be an overlap.
* **Cirrhosis** (scarring, portal hypertension) drives shunting, altered enzyme activity, and protein binding → **broad PK/PD changes** and prescribing risk.
* **High vs low hepatic extraction** drugs behave differently with reduced hepatic blood flow vs reduced enzyme capacity; **first-pass** changes matter.
* HPB tumour taxonomy: liver (HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, adenoma, metastases), pancreas (PDAC, cystic neoplasms, Pan-NEN). Know **diagnosis, spread, and management basics**.

# A. Medical Liver Conditions (non-neoplastic)

## Hepatitis (Acute & Chronic) — **High detail**

**Definition & pattern**

* Necro-inflammatory process with portal ± lobular injury, **interface hepatitis**, apoptosis/coagulative necrosis, and repair → fibrosis/cirrhosis.

**Acute (≤6 mo):** fatigue, anorexia, RUQ tenderness, jaundice; usually 2–4 wk course; minority → acute liver failure. Causes include **HAV/HEV (majority), HBV/HCV/HDV, drugs (e.g., paracetamol), toxins, ischaemia, pregnancy, autoimmune, metabolic (Wilson)**, others. 

**Chronic (>6 mo):** often asymptomatic; leads to cirrhosis/carcinoma depending on aetiology. Causes: **HBV/HCV, alcohol, drugs (methotrexate, amiodarone, isoniazid), AIH, PBC/PSC, A1AT, haemochromatosis, Wilson, MAFLD**.

**Biopsy pearls:** portal inflammation cell mix, **interface hepatitis**, lobular activity; clinicopath correlation required.

**Classic patterns (exam-facing):**

* **HBV:** ground-glass hepatocytes (HBsAg).
* **HCV:** low-grade hepatitis with **lymphoid aggregates** ± steatosis.
* **AIH:** interface hepatitis, **plasma cells**, hepatocyte **rosettes**.
* **Drug hypersensitivity:** **eosinophils** may be prominent.

**Investigations (core set):** LFT pattern (AST/ALT vs ALP/GGT), bilirubin, **synthetic function (albumin, PT/INR)**, viral serology/PCR, autoimmune serology (ANA, SMA, AMA), iron studies, imaging, biopsy when needed.

## Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD/MASLD & MASH) — **High detail**

**Associations:** obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, prior GI surgery, TPN.

**Histology:** **macrovesicular fat**, ballooned hepatocytes, **Mallory–Denk bodies**, lobular inflammation, sinusoidal/pericellular fibrosis (progression risk). 

**Differentials/overlap:** alcohol, drugs (methotrexate, amiodarone), HCV.

---

## Alcohol-Related Liver Disease — **Moderate detail**

**Path features to recall:** **Mallory’s hyaline**, neutrophilic satellitosis.

---

## Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) — **Moderate detail**

* Culprits across patterns (steatosis: **methotrexate, amiodarone**; cholestasis: **flucloxacillin**), hypersensitivity with **eosinophils**. 
* **Paracetamol**: key acute hepatotoxin (see dosing cautions in cirrhosis below).

---

## Cholestasis (Syndromic Pattern) — **High detail**

**General histology:** feathery degeneration, **bile plugs**, ductular reaction, inflammation, fibrosis → cirrhosis.

**Mechanistic buckets:**

* **Pre-hepatic** (excess bilirubin production).
* **Intrahepatic** (PBC, PSC, drugs, inborn errors).
* **Post-hepatic** (extra-hepatic obstruction: gallstones, pancreatic head tumours) with **bile lakes** ± ascending cholangitis/abscess.

---

### Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) — **High detail**

* **Autoimmune small-duct** cholestatic disease: **duct damage**, portal inflammation ± **granulomas**; progressive **duct loss**, interface hepatitis, fibrosis → cirrhosis (4 stages). **AMA positive** serology is typical.  

---

### Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) — **High detail**

* **Largeor small-duct** cholangiopathy: **concentric (“onion-skin”) periductal fibrosis**, inflammation → duct loss; cholestatic labs/imaging.

### Extra-Hepatic Biliary Obstruction (EHBO) — **Moderate detail**

* **Causes:** gallstones, **pancreatic head tumours**.
* **Pathology:** ductal bile plugs, bile lakes/rupture, **ascending cholangitis** (neutrophils), abscesses.

---

## Cirrhosis — **Moderate–High detail**

* End-stage scarring with **portal hypertension**; common sequel of chronic hepatitis, cholestatic disease, MAFLD, alcohol, metabolic diseases.
* Staging/assessment uses **Child-Pugh, MELD**; these **poorly predict metabolic (drug) capacity**, and **shunting** isn’t directly measurable.

---

## Acute Liver Failure — **Brief**

* Rapid loss of liver function (often severe acute hepatitis/DILI); minority of acute hepatitis cases progress.

---

## Inherited/Metabolic Liver Diseases — **Moderate detail (grouped)**

# B. Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Tumours

## Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) — **High detail**

**Epidemiology & risks:** Highest incidence in Asia; strongly linked to **HBV/HCV, alcohol, aflatoxin, haemochromatosis**; in West, usually on **cirrhosis**.

**Gross/micro:** single/multifocal/diffuse; pale masses; **vascular invasion** with satellite nodules. Microscopy shows malignant hepatocytes in **thick plates**, acinar/solid patterns; **fibrolamellar** variant in young; mixed HCC-CC exists. 

**Diagnosis & Management:** imaging ± core/FNA; **resection**, **transplant (in chronic liver disease)**, **TACE**, chemo-radiation, targeted therapies.

---

## Cholangiocarcinoma — **High detail**

* **Biliary epithelium malignancy** (intra/extrahepatic); associations: **PSC**, congenital disorders (e.g., **Caroli**), **liver flukes** (SE Asia). Path: **desmoplastic adenocarcinoma**, tends to **track portal tracts** and invade vessels; metastases to lung/bone/brain; mixed **cholangio-hepatocellular** variants occur.

---

* **Most common malignant liver tumours**, often **multiple**; from **GI**, breast, lung, and many others.

---

## Hepatocellular Adenoma (HCA) — **Moderate–High detail**

* **Young women; oral contraceptives**; complications: **subcapsular rupture/haemorrhage**; **rare progression to HCC** (subtype-dependent). Morphology: **well-demarcated**, sheets of hepatocytes, **no portal tracts**, **prominent arteries/veins**. 

* **Molecular subtypes** (H-HCA, IHCA, β-catenin HCA/b-IHCA) with characteristic **immunomarkers** and **variable HCC risk** (β-catenin exon 3 = high risk). **All**: haemorrhage risk if >5 cm.

---

**Epidemiology:** Among top causes of cancer death; **late presentation**; poor 5-y survival; age >65.

**Risks/precursors:** **Smoking (2–3×)**, new-onset diabetes, **chronic pancreatitis**, family history; **PanIN** dysplasia precedes carcinoma. 

**Pathology & spread:** gland-forming **adenocarcinoma**, perineural spread, early nodes, hematogenous **to liver**. 

**Treatment:** **Whipple** (head) or distal pancreatectomy (body/tail), chemo-radiation, targeted/immunotherapy.

---

## Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms (MCN, IPMN, IOPN) — **High detail**

* **Non-invasive** cystic tumours graded low–high; **excellent prognosis if no invasion**; if invasive, still **better than de-novo PDAC**. Surgical resection for high-risk/high-grade lesions (Whipple vs distal based on site). 

---

## Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms (Pan-NEN) — **Moderate–High detail**

* From **islets** (tail common). All malignant potential: **well-differentiated NET (G1–G3)** vs **poorly differentiated NEC**.

**Diagnosis work-up (service awareness):** **EUS-guided FNA/FNB**, ROSE cytology, specialised needles; multidisciplinary team.

# C. Drugs in Liver Disease (clinical pharmacology)

## Prescribing in Cirrhosis — **High detail**

**Why tricky:** **Shunting** (↓ first-pass & hepatic flow), **variable enzyme down-regulation**, **↓ albumin** (↑ free drug), **ascites** (↑ Vd), **biliary/excretory changes**, and **altered PD** (e.g., CNS sensitivity, fragile coagulation). 

**Extraction ratio principle:**

* **High extraction (flow-limited)**: markedly affected by ↓ hepatic blood flow/shunting → ↑ bioavailability & exposure (e.g., **most β-blockers except atenolol, CCBs, nitrates, opiates, lignocaine, naloxone**).
* **Low extraction (capacity-limited)**: more sensitive to ↓ enzyme activity/↓ protein binding (e.g., **warfarin, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, NSAIDs, theophylline, amiodarone**).

**Clinical corollaries (know examples):**

* **Diazepam** (low extraction) → **↓ clearance & ↑ t½** in cirrhosis; **prefer lorazepam** (glucuronidation).
* **Naloxone**/oxycodone combos: cirrhotic **shunting** can increase naloxone bioavailability → **reduced analgesia**.
* **Verapamil** (high extraction + hepatic metabolism): oral bioavailability ↑ (≈20%→≈50%) and clearance ↓ (\~50%) → **oral dose ↓ 4–5×; IV ↓ \~2×**.
* **Paracetamol**: standard 4 g/day, but conservative practice in cirrhosis uses **2–3 g/day** due to glutathione reserve/CYP2E1 considerations.

**Scores & tests caveat:** **Child-Pugh/MELD** and routine LFTs **do not reliably predict metabolic function** or first-pass impact.
