# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
- Know **basic principles of lipid metabolism** and how this can lead to biochemical derangement and disease
- Understand the relationship between cholesterol level and cardiovascular disease risk. Understand how intensity of lipid control relates to the patientâ€™s other risk factors.
- Understand the options of drug and non-drug treatments for hyperlipidaemia, and how the lipid disorder diagnosis determines the drug choice
- Know the main classes of lipid lowering drugs and their drug targets
- Know the most important adverse effects of commonly used lipid lowering drugs.
- (Understand the importance of hydrophilicity in choice of statin)
- Understand the physiology of **PCSK9**, and use of PSCK9 inhibitors
- Be aware of antisense and small interfering RNA therapies

# Notes

important adverse effects of commonly used lipid lowering drugs
main classes of lipid lowering drugs

Statins:
1. inhibit HMG-CoA reductase => decreases intracellular cholesterol
2. increase SREBPs => increase LDL receptors
3. increase uptake of LDL from blood
4. decreased intracellular cholesterol => decreased secretion of VLDL

Statin side effects
Ezetimibe
PCSK9
- identified 2003
- monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 (trials 2012)
- **decreases LDL receptor expression** => increased plasma LDL
small interfering RNA therapies
- subcutaneous injection
- taken up by the liver
- destroys mRNA for PKS9 synthesis


Lp(a)
- don't what it does (how it doe its)
- but clearly causal ASCVD risk factor

Triglycerides (TG)
- Secondary causes
	- weight loss
	- alcohol
	- control diabetes
	- thyroid
	- diet
