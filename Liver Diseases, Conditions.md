## Cirrhosis

- **Definition**: Fibrous scarring of the liver, characterised by diffuse (entire liver) formation of fibrous septa subdividing the liver parenchyma into nodules, with evidence of hepatocyte regeneration and microvascular damage.
- **Principles**: Can be a final common pathway of virtually any chronic liver injury and is essentially an abnormal pattern of healing. It is a dynamic process and the point at which cirrhosis has occurred is subjective given the way it evolves.
	- Cirrhosis involves hepatocytes, vessels, connective tissue and therefore has impacts on liver structure, all aspects of hepatocyte function and blood flow through the liver.
	- Nodules may be large or small, septa may be delicate or thick. Patterns are influenced by the specific location within th  liver microarchitecture of the damage, but there is lots of overlap.
	- Microscopic events include deposition of collagen in the parenchyma +/- portal tracts, arterialisation +/- obliteration of sinusoids and small veins, and loss of hepatocytes with attempts at regeneration.
	- It is common in chronic liver injury to get focal fibrosis – it’s not considered cirrhosis until it has reached the point of diffuse involvement.
	- Historically, ‘micronodular’ vs ‘macronodular’ cirrhosis and ‘portal cirrhosis’, all of which are not particularly helpful terms given the degree of overlap.
	- In other words, cirrhosis = chronic liver damage. Look for a cause, and consid subsequent consequences.
	- Importantly, cirrhosis does not necessarily correlate closely with abnormal liver function. It is therefore possible and common to have ‘silent’ or subclinical cirrhosis, or have vascular or metabolic sequelae while liver function tests results remain normal.
	- Diagnosable by imaging, liver biopsy not usually necessary.
