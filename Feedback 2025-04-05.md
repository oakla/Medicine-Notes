The content and delivery of Behavioural Science lectures was low value. The takeaways were usually vague concepts that most people of sufficient maturity would already have sufficient grasp on. I'm not sure you can teach that sort of stuff in a lecture format. Maybe a better lecturer could?

It's a similar story for Population Health, most thoughtful people over the age of 25 would be aware of the general concepts delivered. I found the presentations to be depressing and anxiety inducing despite being familiar with the ideas. It was a bit like watching the news.

Finally Aboriginal Health was just straight up pointless. No truly useful skills were communicated and the whole thing felt like a moral sermon. The skills presented were patronizing (e.g. likening blood viscosity to custard) or repackaged normal clinical skills (clinical yarning is just rapport building or 'having a chat'). As for the history of indigenous mistreatment, most people already know about it. 

To be clear, I appreciate the importance of these subjects, I just think they were poorly delivered or given such shallow treatment that most content was not new to most people. This may be a side-effect of being a postgrad learning along side undergrads.
