3. What structural processes can cause rectal bleeding?
	1. haemarrhoids
4. Complete a surgical sieve (VITAMIN CDEF) for Doug’s bleeding, and highlight the four most likely causes

## Constipation
1. What are the requirements for normal bowel function? (i.e. what happens to make a normal stool)
2. What structural processes can cause constipation?
3. What are some functional causes? (think about neurological factors controlling bowel function)
