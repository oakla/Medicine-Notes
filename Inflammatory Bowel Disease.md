## Chron Disease vs Ulcerative Colitis
from ChatGPT

| Feature                      | **Ulcerative Colitis (UC)**               | **Crohn’s Disease (CD)**                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**               | Chronic IBD limited to the **colon and rectum**                                                | Chronic IBD that can affect **any part of the GI tract**                          |
| **Distribution**             | Always involves **rectum**, spreads proximally in a **continuous** fashion                     | **Skip lesions** (discontinuous), can affect mouth → anus                         |
| **Depth of Inflammation**    | **Mucosa & submucosa only**                                                                    | **Transmural** (full thickness)                                                   |
| **Gross Pathology**          | Continuous inflammation, pseudopolyps, loss of haustra (“lead pipe” on imaging)                | Cobblestone mucosa, strictures, fistulas, creeping fat                            |
| **Histology**                | Crypt abscesses, mucosal ulceration                                                            | Non-caseating granulomas (not always present)                                     |
| **Symptoms**                 | Bloody diarrhoea, urgency, tenesmus, LLQ pain                                                  | Diarrhoea (often non-bloody), abdominal pain (often RLQ), weight loss, fistulae   |
| **Extraintestinal Features** | Arthritis, uveitis, erythema nodosum, **Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)** strongly linked | Arthritis, uveitis, erythema nodosum, kidney stones (oxalate), gallstones         |
| **Complications**            | Toxic megacolon, colorectal carcinoma                                                          | Fistulas, strictures, abscesses, malabsorption, colon cancer (risk also ↑)        |
| **Smoking**                  | **Protective**                                                                                 | **Risk factor**                                                                   |
| **Surgery**                  | **Curative** (colectomy)                                                                       | Not curative (disease often recurs)                                               |
| **Pharmacology**             | 5-ASA (mesalazine), steroids, immunomodulators, biologics                                      | Similar drug ladder, but biologics (anti-TNF, anti-integrin) more commonly needed |
| **Cancer Risk**              | ↑ risk of **colorectal carcinoma** with duration and extent of disease                         | ↑ risk of colorectal carcinoma (less than UC if colon not involved)               |

## Mnemonics for UC vs Crohn’s

### 🔹 Ulcerative Colitis

**“ULCER”**

* **U** – Ulceration of mucosa only
* **L** – Lead pipe colon (loss of haustra on imaging)
* **C** – Continuous inflammation, starts at rectum
* **E** – Extends proximally, no skip lesions
* **R** – Risk of colorectal carcinoma ↑, Removal (colectomy) = cure

---

### 🔹 Crohn’s Disease

**“CROHN”**

* **C** – Cobblestone mucosa
* **R** – Right-sided pain (often ileum, RLQ)
* **O** – Obstruction, fistulas, strictures
* **H** – High risk with smoking
* **N** – Non-caseating granulomas, Nutrient malabsorption (B12, iron)

---

### 🔹 Contrast Hooks (Quick Recall)

* **Smoking**: UC = “Unlikely with smoking” (protective) | Crohn’s = “Caused by smoking” (risk factor)
* **Distribution**: UC = “Uniform & Continuous” | Crohn’s = “Cracked & Patchy”
* **Depth**: UC = “Ulcer *Superficial*” | Crohn’s = “Cracks go *deep* (transmural)”
* **Cancer**: UC = high colorectal risk | Crohn’s = cancer risk only if colon involved
* **Surgery**: UC = cured by colectomy | Crohn’s = “Comes back” after surgery

### 🔹 Visual Memory Aid

Think:

* **UC** → imagine **paint spreading smoothly up a wall** (continuous, mucosal).
* **Crohn’s** → imagine **potholes on a road** (skip lesions, deep, patchy).
