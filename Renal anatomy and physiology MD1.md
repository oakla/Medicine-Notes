## 🩺 Kidney Function I — Key Concepts

### Functions of the Kidney

* **Regulation:** body fluid osmolarity/volume, blood pressure, electrolytes, acid–base balance.
* **Excretion:** metabolic wastes (urea, creatinine, uric acid, bilirubin), foreign substances (drugs, toxins), excess water/ions.
* **Endocrine & Metabolic:** EPO, renin, vitamin D activation, clearance of hormones, gluconeogenesis.

---

### Nephron Structure

* **Components:** renal corpuscle (glomerulus + Bowman’s capsule), proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, collecting duct.
* **Types:**

  * **Cortical (80%)**: short Loops of Henle, stay in cortex/outer medulla.
  * **Juxtamedullary (20%)**: long Loops of Henle deep in medulla; crucial for urine concentration.
* **Blood vessels:** afferent arteriole → glomerulus → efferent arteriole → peritubular capillaries/vasa recta.

---

### Nephron Processes

* **Filtration:** plasma (minus large proteins & cells) enters Bowman’s space.
* **Reabsorption:** \~99% of water and useful solutes recovered into blood.
* **Secretion:** wastes, drugs, excess ions actively moved into tubules.
* **Excretion:** filtration + secretion − reabsorption → urine.

---

### Renal Blood Flow

* Kidneys: <0.5% body mass but receive \~20–25% of cardiac output.
* Cortex receives \~95% of blood flow.
* **Two capillary beds in series:**

  1. Glomerular (high pressure, filtration).
  2. Peritubular/vasa recta (low pressure, reabsorption).

---

### Filtration & GFR

* **Filtration barrier:** endothelial pores, basement membrane (negatively charged), podocyte slits.
* **Determinants:** size, charge, membrane area & permeability.
* **GFR (healthy adult):** \~125 mL/min (180 L/day).

  * Too high → poor reabsorption.
  * Too low → waste retention, hypoxia risk.
* **Net Filtration Pressure (NFP):**
  NFP = GBHP − CHP − BCOP ≈ 10 mmHg.

---

### Regulation of GFR

* **Arteriolar resistance:**

  * Afferent constriction → ↓ RBF, ↓ GFR.
  * Efferent constriction → ↓ RBF, ↑ GFR.
* **Mechanisms:**

  1. **Autoregulation**

     * *Myogenic:* afferent arteriole adjusts to BP changes.
     * *Tubuloglomerular feedback:* macula densa senses NaCl via NKCC2; alters afferent tone via NO, adenosine, renin.
  2. **Neural:** sympathetic stimulation (noradrenaline) reduces RBF/GFR during stress/haemorrhage.
  3. **Hormonal:**

     * ANP: dilates afferent, constricts efferent → ↑ GFR.
     * Angiotensin II: mainly efferent constriction, helps maintain GFR while ↓ RBF.

---

### Fine Tuning

* **Mesangial cells:** contract → reduce filtration surface area → ↓ GFR.
* Modulated by AngII, ANP, ADH, NO, capillary stretch.


## 🩺 Kidney Function II — Key Concepts

### Tubular Reabsorption

* **Highly selective.**

  * 100% glucose, nearly all amino acids.
  * \~99% salts and water.
  * Wastes (creatinine, much urea) not reabsorbed.
* **Mechanisms:**

  * **Active transport:** Na+, H+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+.
  * **Secondary active transport:** glucose, amino acids, Cl−, H+ (coupled with Na+).
  * **Pinocytosis:** small proteins (<50 kDa).
  * **Passive transport:** Cl−, HCO3−, urea, water.
  * **Osmosis:** water follows Na+ (aquaporins, solvent drag).

---

### Segmental Nephron Function

* **Proximal Tubule (PCT):**

  * Reabsorbs \~65% NaCl & water, 100% glucose & amino acids.
  * Major site of secretion (H+, organic acids/bases, drugs).
  * Brush border → ↑ surface area; loaded with transporters.
* **Loop of Henle (LoH):**

  * Descending: permeable to water, little ion transport.
  * Ascending (especially thick limb): impermeable to water, active Na+K+2Cl− transport; lumen +ve drives Ca2+/Mg2+ reabsorption.
* **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT):**

  * Early: “diluting segment” (NaCl reabsorption, impermeable to water).
  * Late + Cortical Collecting Tubule:

    * **Principal cells:** reabsorb Na+, secrete K+ (aldosterone sensitive).
    * **Intercalated cells:** secrete H+, reabsorb HCO3− & K+.
* **Collecting Ducts:**

  * **Cortical CD:** ADH makes it water permeable; impermeable to urea.
  * **Medullary CD:** permeable to urea (with ADH), contributing to medullary gradient.

---

### Producing Dilute vs Concentrated Urine

* **Dilute urine (<50 mOsm/L):**
  * The 'default mode' of the nephron
	  * water only reabsorbed in the PCT and descending LoH
	  * rest of the tubule (DCT/CD) reabsorbs salt but remains water impermeable (ADH absent)
* **Concentrated urine (up to 1200–1400 mOsm/L in humans):**
  * Requires:
    * ADH (↑ aquaporins in DCT/CD).
    * Hyperosmotic medullary interstitium.
    * Countercurrent multiplier (Loop of Henle) + exchanger (vasa recta).
    * Urea recycling (contributes \~40–50% of medullary osmolarity).

---
### Countercurrent Systems
* **Countercurrent Multiplier (Loop of Henle):**
  * Descending limb: water leaves, fluid equilibrates with interstitium.
  * Thick ascending limb: active Na+K+2Cl− transport, impermeable to water → dilutes tubular fluid, concentrates interstitium.
* **Urea Recirculation:**
  * With ADH, urea diffuses from inner medullary CD → interstitium → LoH → back to CD.
  * Maintains high osmolarity in medulla.
* **Vasa Recta (Countercurrent Exchanger):**
  * Low medullary blood flow (<5% RBF).
  * Slow, countercurrent exchange prevents washout of medullary gradient.

---

### Key Regulatory Hormones

* **Aldosterone:** ↑ Na+ reabsorption, ↑ K+ secretion (principal cells).
* **ADH:** ↑ water reabsorption (DCT/CD aquaporins), ↑ urea permeability (inner medullary CD).
* **ANP:** promotes natriuresis (not emphasised here, but ties to lecture I).



## Anatomy 1 - Urinary System Development — Key Concepts

### Big Picture

* **Theme:** Human renal development mirrors vertebrate evolution (pro→meso→metanephros) and is tightly linked to reproductive tract development.
* **Clinical anchor:** Fetal renal function drives amniotic fluid volume; deviations produce multisystem consequences.
---
### Embryologic Origins

* **Source tissue:** Kidneys, ureters, and much of the lower urinary tract derive from the **intermediate mesoderm (IMM)** of the urogenital ridge. (Adrenal cortex largely from lateral plate mesoderm.)
* **Segmental plan:** IMM forms **nephrotomes** (cranial→caudal), setting up three kidney “generations.”
---
### Three “Kidneys” (Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny)

#### 1) **Pronephros** (cervical; week \~4 → regresses by week \~5)
* Non-functional in humans; likely a signaling scaffold for the mesonephric duct.
#### 2) **Mesonephros** (thoracic/lumbar; appears end of week 4)
* Produces small amounts of “urine” **weeks 6–12** drained via the **mesonephric duct**, into the cloaca, thus keeping the mesonephric duct patent.
* Thoracic segments regress from **week 5**; lumbar segments persist to **weeks 10–12**.
* Architecture favors **smaller glomeruli + larger tubules** → filtration with **reabsorption** 
	* larger tubules allow for (more) reabsorption, a preadaption to terrestial life
#### 3) **Metanephros** — the definitive kidney (sacral origin)
- Most of the **definitive kidney** (glomeruli and nephron tubules up to the DCT)
	* **Ureteric bud (metanephric duct)** sprouts from the **dorsal mesonephric duct** at **week 5** → induces adjacent IMM to become **metanephric mesenchyme** (nephrons: glomeruli + tubules).
* Drainage system (collecting ducts → calyces → pelvis → ureter)
	* Ureteric bud repeatedly bifurcates → **collecting system** (collecting ducts → calyces → pelvis → ureter).
* **Division of labor:**
  * Ureteric bud = **drainage/collecting system**
  * Metanephric mesenchyme = **nephron (pre-collecting duct) structures**
---
### Fetal Kidney Function & Amniotic Fluid
* **Urine appears:** early mesonephric output by **week 6**; **metanephric urine by week \~12**.
* By **week \~16**, kidneys are the **primary source** of amniotic fluid. Adequate fluid requires functioning kidneys and patent outflow.
* **Consequence of low amniotic fluid** (Oligohydramnios): 
	* pulmonary hypoplasia → neonatal RDS; 
	* gut hypomotility/feeding issues; 
	* malrotation of intestines; 
	* issues from compression (e.g. MSk, facial, growth restrction)

---
### Kidney Ascent & Vascular Remodeling
* **Ascent begins in week 6** 
	* metanephric kidney 
		* coexists with *meso*nephros
		* **retroperitoneal**
		* is **dorsal** to mesonephric duct and gonad.
* **Arterial pattern:** 
	* as the kidneys ascend, cranially they “acquire” successive lateral branches from the aorta 
	* caudal branches are **sequentially pruned** (
	* results in 5 or fewer persisting; more than 5 is atypical
* **Venous pattern:** 
	* climbs over “ladder-like” **subcardinal system** (leftover mesonephric scaffold).
	* Obliteration of the ladder-like subcardinal system:
		* left side in obliterated, leaving IVC on right side
		* explains asymmetry
- left renal 
	- drains left adrenal, renal and gonad
	- longer because it must travel over the aorta to attach to the IVC 
	- travels under the SMA => creates 'nutcracker vulnerability'
---
### Adult Position & Relations (Clinical Patterns)

* **Primary retroperitoneal**; embedded in **perirenal fat → renal fascia → pararenal fat**.
* Poles at **ribs 11–12**; **right kidney lower** (liver).
* **Hilum (anterior→posterior):** **Vein → Artery → Ureter (V→A→U)**.
* **Left renal vein** 
	* may be compressed (nutcracker); 
	* longer due to venous remodeling. 
* *These are patterns, not absolute rules.*
---
### Developmental Anomalies (High-Yield)
* **Horseshoe kidney (\~1/500):** fusion at lower poles; ascent arrested by **IMA**.
* Conditions that reduce amniotic fluid volume
	* Reduction in nephron numbe or drainager: 
		* Hypoplasia (\~1/400) 
		* unilateral agenesis (\~1/1000–2000)
	* **Outflow anomalies:** 
		* duplicated ureters (duplicated buds)
		* ureteric obstruction
		* malpartition of major calyces (should be 3 for balanced drainage)
---
### Bladder & Trigone Development
* **Cloaca** is mostly hindgut-derived
* The **uro-rectal** septum 
	* **partitions the cloaca** into:
		* Urogenital sinus (anterior) → bladder + urethra
		* Anorectal canal (posterior) → rectum + anal canal
	* IMM drevied 
* **Trigone**: 
	* triangular area at the base of the bladder, between the two ureteric orifices and the urethral opening
	* derivative of the mesonephric ducts (IMM), incorporated into the bladder wall
* Allantois
	* becomes bladder + urachus (median umbilical ligament) if it obliterates normally
	* if urachus does not obliterate, can result in:
		* Urachal fistula - full connection
		- Urachal sinus - really deep belly button
		- Urachal cyst - lump/cyst in umbilical ligament
---
### Key Timelines (Exam-friendly)
* **Wk 4:** Pronephros appears (cervical).
* **Wk \~5:** Pronephros regresses; **ureteric bud** sprouts; thoracic mesonephros begins to regress.
* **Wk 6:** Mesonephros producing small volumes; **kidney ascent begins**; cloacal septation.
* **Wks 6–12:** Mesonephros drains via mesonephric duct.
* **Wks 10–12:** Lumbar mesonephros regresses; **metanephric urine** present by \~12.
* **Wk \~16:** Kidneys = **primary** amniotic fluid source.
* **By 12 wks:** Anal canal, vagina, urethra present (context for cloacal partitioning).

---

### High-Yield Associations & Clinical Correlates

* **Renal–gonadal relationship:** shared mesonephric scaffolding explains parallel development and final anatomic relations (e.g., gonadal vessels).
* **Retroperitoneal ascent** explains crossing patterns and variable segmental vascular supply (arteries “picked up” en route).
* **Low amniotic fluid** (Oligohydramnios sequence): think airway, gut, growth, face, limbs. Manage by identifying **renal output** or **outflow obstruction** issues.

---
### Quick Check (self-test prompts)

* **What tissues form the collecting system vs. nephron?**
* **Why is the left renal vein longer and often anterior to the aorta?**
* **When does the kidney start contributing most to amniotic fluid?**
* **Which vessel halts ascent in a horseshoe kidney?**
* **What’s the embryologic origin of the trigone vs. the rest of the bladder mucosa?**

### Tom's Summary
- Kidney development begins in the cervical spine, continuing down the vertebral column, until the definitive metanephric kidney develops in the sacral region. It ascends a ladder-like system of vasculature that pre-existed because of the mesonephros, which helps to explain some of the patterns seen in adult anatomy – both normal and abnormal. How the mesonephros changes with time also plays a key role in reproductive development.
- The ureter is IMM derived, as it sprouts from the dorsal aspect of the mesonephric duct, inducing the surrounding IMM to become metanephric mesenchyme – creating the definitive kidney.
	- Ureteric/metanephric bud = ‘drainage aspect’ = collecting ducts down ureter
	- Metanephric mesenchyme = structure of the kidney, including nephron components pre-collecting duct.
- The fetal kidney is not idle, ‘urine’ is made from week 6 and metanephric urine become primarily contributor to amniotic fluid volume from week 16. Making amniotic fluid volume a measure of kidney function, where low urine output becomes a multisystem issue.
- Being primary retroperitoneal, the kidney ascends dorsally to most other things, creating important anatomical relationships, in terms of what crosses in front/behind of what. It sits within its own fascia, surrounded by a large amount of fat.
- The ureter has a complex blood/nerve supply, reflecting its ontogeny, with the upper ureter being similar in supply to the kidneys and the lower ureter being similar to the bladder, with everything in between being a bit of a mix.
- The bladder being derived from the hindgut creates a pattern that can be used to understand its general structure, and how if the urorectal septum could splice the two systems incorrectly – leading to fistulas and alike

## 🩺Anatomy 2 - Urinary Anatomy & Histology – Key Structures

---
### 🟦 Kidney – Gross Anatomy

- **Nerve supply**  
  - Sympathetic: T9–L1 (↓ GFR, ↑ renin)  
  - Parasympathetic: Vagus (possible opposite effects)

---

### 🟨 Nephron & Histology
- **Nephron components** (≈1 million/kidney)  
  1. Bowman’s capsule  
  2. Glomerulus (together = renal corpuscle)  
  3. Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)  
  4. Loop of Henle (thick & thin segments)  
  5. Distal convoluted tubule (DCT)  
  6. Collecting ducts
- **Glomerulus anatomy**  
  - Afferent & efferent arterioles  
  - Juxtaglomerular apparatus:  
    - Mesangial cells (debris clearance)  
    - JG cells (renin release)  
    - Macula densa (Na⁺/Cl⁻ sensing)  
  - Podocytes → pedicels → slit diaphragms  
  - Basement membrane barrier
- **Cortical vs. juxtamedullary nephrons**  
  - Cortical (~80–90%): short LoH, peritubular capillaries  
  - Juxtamedullary (~10–20%): long LoH, vasa recta → countercurrent multiplication

---

### 🟥 Ureter
- **Course**  
  1. Narrowing at pelvi-ureteric junction  
  2. Crossing iliac vessels (pelvic brim)  
  3. Intramural bladder wall
- **Blood supply**  
  - Upper ureter: renal artery branches  
  - Lower ureter: vesicular branches of internal iliac
- **Nerve supply**  
  - Sympathetic: T9–L2 (↓ peristalsis, ↑ tone)  
  - Parasympathetic: vagus (upper), pelvic splanchnics S2–S4 (lower, ↑ peristalsis)

---

### 🟩 Bladder
- **Shape**: triangular pyramid (4 surfaces, 4 points)  
  - **Trigone** (posterior, receives ureters)  
  - **Apex** → urachus (median umbilical ligament)  
  - **Neck** → urethral exit (internal sphincter)  
- **Muscle**: detrusor (3 layers)  
  - Inner longitudinal  
  - Middle circular  
  - Outer longitudinal
- **Histology**  
  - Transitional epithelium (urothelium)  
  - Thick muscularis externa  
  - Adventitia (retroperitoneal)

### Tom's Summary
 - The segments of a kidney are defined by the segmental arteries, which do not anastomose with each other, meaning that infarction to one of them can cause the entire segment to become necrotic.
- The cortex and medulla of a kidney contain different aspects of a nephron, which is why they look so different. There are parts of the cortex that encroach on medullary territory, and parts of the medulla that encroach into cortical territory.
- The glomerulus is a specialised filter that joins the blood component to the urinary excretion component, where specialised cells, structures, spaces allows for a highly selective barrier, which each part playing a slightly different role.
- Not all nephrons have equal function, which is in part due to the differences in the length of the LoH, but also in how the efferent arteriole system interacts with that loop.
- The histological appearance of different tubules can be matched to its functional demand, because of the structural requirement related to holding organelles for said function (e.g. microvilli for increased surface area for reabsorption)
- The kidneys and ureters are primary retroperitoneal, which means they pass behind most other visceral related structures. The blood supply and nerve supply of the ureter is tricky because of the migratory nature of their development. Meaning the more cranial aspects relate to progressively more cranial arteries spinal nerve levels, which is why ureteric stone pain moves down the body wall dermatomes. It can also be said that the kidney end has the same supply as the kidney and the bladder end has the same supply as the bladder.
- The development of the ureter being from the dorsal aspect of the mesonephric tube also describes the morphology of how it enters the bladder, and why the ureterovesical junction does not require a sphincter/valve. The intramural aspect of the ureter performs that function, because part of the ureter is dragged through the length of the bladder wall during development.

## 📝 Renal Physiology – Salt & Water Balance

### Lecture Outcomes

* Water balance (    )
* Na⁺ balance (    )
* K⁺ balance (    )

---

### Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)

water osmolarity in renal tubules: 50-1200 mOsmoles

reduces water loss through kidneys: increases water reabsorption (DCT/CT/CD)
- (Does other things too)

* **Stimulus for release:**    Osmolarity of Na (dominant driver)      
* **Site of synthesis:**    supraoptic (5/6th) and paraventricular (1/6th) nuclei          
* **Site of release:**      posterior pituitary      
* **Mechanism of action on nephron:**     triggers exocytosis of aquaporins onto cells surface     
* **Aquaporins involved:**         AQP-2 aquaporins on *apical* surface   
* **Effect on plasma osmolarity & urine concentration:**  
	* plasma osmolarity down
	* urine concentration up

---

### Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System (RAAS)
- retains Na
- does not change plasma osmolarity because ADH dominates
- Angiotensin is converted in the lungs by Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) into Angiotensin II (AtII)
- AtII stimulates release of Aldosterone from the adrenal cortex
#### Renin
* **Secreted by:**   granula cells in the JGA        
* **Stimuli for secretion:**     \[NaCl\] in DCT - detected by macula densa of the JGA

#### Angiotensin II (AtII)
- short half-life
* **Direct effects on nephron:**            
	* Na reabsorption - MOSTLY first half (PCT)
	* increase Na-K pump
	* increase Na/H exchange *if it can*
* **Other effects (systemic):**           
	* stims aldosterone secretion

#### Aldosterone
- steroid hormone => longer half (hours)
* **Secreted by:**         andrenal cortex       
* **Main stimuli:**           Angio-II     
* **Cellular mechanism:**              
	* increase NaK ATPase
	* increases permeability of Na and increase Na transporters
* **Effects on Na⁺, K⁺, H⁺:**     
	* increases Na absorption in later parts of tubule (cortical CT)      
	* to get Na, K and H is exchanged into lumen
	* lowers K and H levels because no chance to resorb after pumping out

---

### Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)
the counter to RAAS
* **Stimulus for release:**          
	* stretch on atria   
* **Effects on kidney:**             
	* switches off things that Ald swithced on - switches off Na reabsorption
* **Effects on BP/volume:**    
	* Decrease

---

### Potassium Balance

* **Normal plasma \[K⁺]:**           
	* low but very tightly controlled
* **Site of regulated K⁺ secretion in nephron:** 
	* late DCT/CT
* **Determinants of secretion rate:**        
	* mostly NaK pump
	* also permeability and EC gradient
* **Aldosterone role in K⁺ balance:**    
	* reduces K reabsorption because it acts on the later half of the renal tubule

Dead or damage cells can release abnormal amount of K

---

### Thirst Mechanism

* **Stimuli for thirst:**              
	* increase in Osmo (main)
	* angiotensin - is also an NT that triggers other receptors that trigger thirst 
* **Hypothalamic centres involved:**        
	* Hypothalamic anteroventral-3rd-ventricle (AV3V) region
* **Integration with ADH release:**    
	* AV3V neurons lie outside BBB, & use AtII as a neurotransmitter → AtII potentiates thirst

AV3V projects to supraoptic & paraventricular nuclei (where ADH synthesis happens)

---

### Salt Appetite

* **Stimuli:**    
	* decrease plasma Na conc
	* low BP/vol (also stims thirst)
	* AtII
* **Shared regulation with thirst:**      
	* low BP
	* AtII

---

### Integration & Summary

* **Interactions between ADH, AtII, Aldosterone, ANP:**    
* **How these systems regulate BP and volume together:**

## Kidney Physiology 4 - Acid–Base Balance

### Acid–Base Homeostasis

* **Normal arterial pH**: 7.4
- CO2 is a 'lewis acid'
### Normal Values

* **Define**:
  * **Acidosis** (process)/ **Acidaemia** (state): Art pH < 7.35
  * **Alkalosis** (process)/ **Alkalaemia** (state): art pH > 7.45

* **Fill in typical pH values**:
  * **Arterial blood**: 7.4
  * **Venous blood/ Interstitial Fluid**: 7.35 (ISF carries the CO2 that makes venous blood more acidic)
  * **ICF**: 7.35 (because 
  * **Urine**: 7.35
  * **Gastric HCl**: 0.8

---

### pH Effects

* **On metabolism**: reduces enzyme activity
* **On neuromuscular system**:
	* **pH affects Plasma Ca²⁺-albumin binding**:
  * Acidosis → inhibitory
	  * increases free Ca => blocks Na voltage gated channels => muscle inhibition
	  * increases => plasma K conc
  * Alkalosis → excitatory
	* opposite of above
	* also makes muscles weaker because of 
* **K⁺ balance changes**:

---

### Clinical Consequences

* **List systemic effects of *acidaemia* (CV, metabolic, neuro, resp)**:
	* hyperventilation
	* cerebral dysfunction => coma
	* headaches
* **List systemic effects of *alkalaemia* (CV, metabolic, neuro, resp)**:
	* muscular weakness (from over activation), tetanus, pain, tremors
	* hypoventilation

---

### Daily Acid Load

* **Fixed acid produced per kg/day**:
* **Main sources of acid**:
	* food
	* bicarbonate production (e.g. pancreas)

---

### Defense Mechanisms

* **Buffering** (speed, capacity, key systems):
	* e.g. bicarb in blood
	* bones
* **Pulmonary regulation**:
	* PCO2
* **Renal regulation**:

pKa of a buffer acid determines the optimal pH for effectiveness of that buffer
bicarbonate's pKa (6.37) is not where we want it (7.4) => so we compensate by using lots of it

---

### Buffer Systems

* **Main ECF buffer**: bicarb
* **Main ICF buffer**: phospahte
* Proteins also used
* **Henderson–Hasselbalch equation**:

---

### Respiratory Control
"very effective"
* **Hyperventilation effect**: alkilosis
* **Hypoventilation effect**: acidosis
* **Approximate pH change if VA doubles**:
	* 0.23 (7.4 → 7.63) - well into alkilosis
* **Approximate pH change if VA drops to ¼**:
	* 0.45 (7.4 → 6.95) - well into acidosis

---

### Renal Control

* **How are HCO₃⁻ and H⁺ handled**?
	* bicarb in filtrate by default
	* no bicarb transporter to reabsorb on *apical* side
	* instead 
		* H ions are pumped into lumen
		* carbonic anhydrase in lumen converts H and bicarb to CO2
		* **CO2** is reabsorbed
	* overall pH adjustment is determined by amount of H secreted
		* if alkolosis => pump no H
		* if acidosis => pump lots of H
* **Mechanisms of H⁺ secretion in nephron segments**:
	* In early part (PCT, TAL, early DCT) where there's lots of bicarb: 
		1. Basal NaK-pump => Na into interstitium. Creates **secondary active transport drive**
		2. Apical Na-Proton exchanger (Na in, H out). Secondary active transport driven by step 1
	- In late part
		1. CO2 from interstial fluid. Generates H in lumen cells 
		2. H pumped into lumen and electro balanced with Cl
	- H (as ammonium) can also can be generated from glutamate (less important)
* **Link between K⁺ imbalance and alkalosis**:
	* K and H move in opposite directions (electroneutrality)
	* alkalosis causes high K loss (hypokalaemia)
	* to a lesser extent, alkalosis cause K to shift into ICF from plasma

---

### Acid–Base Disorders

* **How to determine *metabolic vs respiratory***?
	* aterial blood analysis:
		* high PCO2 => resp
		* high bicarb => metabolic
* **Primary variable altered in**:

  * **Metabolic disorders**:
  * **Respiratory disorders**:
* **Compensation**:

  * **Respiratory acidosis**:
	  * decreased pH, increased CO2
  * **Respiratory alkalosis**:
  * **Metabolic acidosis**:
  * **Metabolic alkalosis**:

---

### Anion Gap
- 
- distinguishes two types of meta acidosis
- increase A gap => exogenous or endogenous **H source** (or poison)
	- e.g. ketoacidosis, drugs
- normal A gap =>
	- loss of bicarb in diahorrea, carbonic anhydrase-inhibitors

---

### Summary Notes

* **Key take-home points from this lecture**:
	* Acid-base balance is regulated by buffers, ventilation and kidneys
	* acid-base disorders can be metabolic or respiratory
	* metabolic disorders create respiratory compensation
	* repsiratory disorders create metabolic compensation
