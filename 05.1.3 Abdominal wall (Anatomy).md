# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts

- abdominal + pelvic cavity = continuous space
- regions and dermatomes
- **Boundaries/Walls**
	- rectus adominus muscles, the abdominal sheath and its boundaries and partitioning lines
- abdomincal Wall functions
- Layers
# Notes
## regions and dermatomes
- T5, 6, or 7 runs to sternum
- T10 dermatome contains umbillicus 
- L1 is at the lowest point of the abdominal wall
## Boundaries/Walls
- superior: diaphragm muscle
- inferior: pelvic diaphragm
- posterior: 
	- Bony: Vertebral bodies, ribs, iliac fossa
	- Muscular: 
		- Diaphragm cura and Diaphragm domes
		- Ilio-psoas
		- quadratus lumborum
		- transversus abdominis
- Anterior & Lateral
	- same pattern as in thorax walls (external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominus), plus one more: **rectus abdominus**
	- The rectus adominus muscles insert into the abdominal sheath, which runs parrallel to them
## Functions of the abdominal wall
1. Containment and protection
2. Generate pressure to support evacuations and expulsions upwards (breath) and downwards (urine, faeces, babies)
3. Posture
