Chapter 14 Cardiovascular system

In the early stages of development, the respiratory, excretory and nutritional requirements of the embryo are provided by simple diffusion. As the conceptus increases in size, diffusion is inadequate for its nutritional, respiratory and excretory needs. Consequently, the mammalian embryo requires a system for delivering oxygen and nutrients to its tissues and for removing its waste products. These requirements are supplied by the cardiovascular system. As one of the first functional systems to develop in the embryo, the cardiovascular system consists of a central pumping organ, the heart, linked to a set of arteries which convey blood to the tissues. Complementary vessels, called veins, carry blood from the tissues back to the heart. An associated network, the lymphatic system, assists in the return of extracellular fluids to the vasculature.

Blood vessel formation occurs as a consequence of two sequential processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Vasculogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from blood islands, commences during the third week of gestation in domestic mammals, first in the yolk sac and later in the allantois. A number of factors including fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf‐2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the angiopoietin proteins have an initiating role in vasculogenesis. Fibroblast growth factor induces splanchnic mesodermal cells to form haemangioblasts in the yolk sac. Vascular endothelial growth factors are a family of proteins which are key to vasculogenesis and are expressed at high levels in areas proximal to active blood vessel formation. These signalling factors act on tyrosine kinase receptors such as Flk1 present on both haemangioblasts and angioblasts and subsequently promote the differentiation of angioblasts into endothelial vessels.

The contribution of haemangioblasts to the formation of blood vessels and to haematopoiesis is outlined in [Figure 14.1](https://veteriankey.com/cardiovascular-system-4/#c14-fig-0001).

Figure 14.1 Outline of the origin and differentiation of angioblasts and haematopoietic stem cells from a common mesodermal precursor, the haemangioblast. The haematopoietic stem cell initially gives rise to a primitive erythroid lineage but as maturation proceeds definitive erythrocytes and myeloid cells are produced, along with cells from which the lymphoid lineage develops.

Angiopoietins promote the interaction between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells which eventually surround some developing blood vessels. Development of blood vessels involves a complex series of events during which endothelial cells differentiate, proliferate, migrate and become organised into an orderly vascular network. Splanchnic mesodermal cells lining the yolk sac form clusters, referred to as blood islands. With the formation of extra‐embryonic vascular channels, a primitive circulatory system becomes established. In contrast to vasculogenesis, angiogenesis comprises several morphogenic events during which pre‐existing endothelial cells sprout, branch and become canalised. Other processes that occur during angiogenesis include the remodelling of existing vessels through anastomosis and branching accompanied by increases in luminal diameter. This process, a fundamental requirement for embryological development, continues postnatally. VEGF‐a is critial to angiogenesis and is produced by mesenchymal cells. This factor acts on the endothelial cells at points where new vessel formation commences, termed ‘tip’ cells. These tip cells express Delta‐like‐4 (DLL4) which is a ligand to Notch receptor, while adjacent cells express Notch. The expression of Notch receptor prevents these latter cells from responding to VEGF‐a, (unlike the DLL4‐expressing tip cells) thereby spacing the development of new blood vessels. Angiopoietin 1 subsequently interacts with receptor Tie‐2 on endothelial cells at sites where sprouting occurs. At these points, endothelial cells can proliferate and form new vessels. In response to the angiopoietin 1–Tie‐2 interactions, which occur during angiogenesis, endothelial cells release the signalling molecule platelet‐derived growth factor (PDGF) which stimulates migration of mesenchymal cells towards the vascular endothelium. In response to the release of other growth factors by endothelial cells, differentiation of mesenchymal cells into vascular smooth muscle cells occurs.

When initially formed, the haematopoietic islands are compact structures. As development progresses, cells at the periphery of the blood islands, under the influence of growth factors, become squamous in shape and surround the centrally‐located cells. The squamous cells form the endothelial lining of the emerging vascular system and the round, centrally‐located cells become the haemoblastic cells or embryonic nucleated erythrocytes ([Fig 14.2](https://veteriankey.com/cardiovascular-system-4/#c14-fig-0002)).

Vascular development occurs under the influence of specific growth factors. Basic fibroblast growth factor, which binds to receptors on splanchnic mesodermal cells, induces them to form haemangioblasts. Vascular endothelial growth factor promotes the differentiation of peripheral haemangioblasts in blood islands into angioblasts which, in turn, differentiate into endothelial cells and form blood vessels. Maturation of the capillary network is influenced by PDGF and transforming growth factor‐β (Tgf‐β). Development of individual channels in the network depends on the volume and direction of blood flow. The channels which convey the greatest volume of blood increase in diameter and acquire additional tissue layers from the surrounding mesoderm, becoming thick‐walled vessels referred to as arteries; the other vessels, veins, remain thin walled. Blood vessels which develop in the foetal membranes, referred to as extra‐embryonic vessels, consist of paired vitelline (yolk sac) and umbilical (allantoic) arteries and veins. Intra‐embryonic formation of blood vessels, which proceeds in a similar manner to extra‐embryonic vasculogenesis, commences soon after blood vessel formation begins in the extra‐embryonic membranes. Subsequently, the extra‐embryonic and intra‐embryonic vessels anastomose, completing the rudimentary circulatory system of the conceptus ([Fig 14.3](https://veteriankey.com/cardiovascular-system-4/#c14-fig-0003)).

## Molecular aspects of cardiac development

Bilateral fields of cardiac precursor cells form two populations, referred to as the first and second heart fields. The first heart field forms the heart tube and contributes to the development of the left ventricle and all other parts of the heart except the cardiac outflow tract (pulmonary trunk and aortic regions). Cells derived from the second heart field contribute to the development of the cardiac outflow tract, right ventricle and most of the atria. Both of these fields display distinct expression of marker genes. For example, *HCN4* marks the first heart field, while *Isl1* is expressed only in the second heart field. Precursors within the two fields give rise to distinct lineages and differentiate according to divergent transcriptional programs.

The transcription factor Nkx‐2.5 is central to the initial induction of splanchnic mesodermal cells which ultimately contribute to cardiogenic mesoderm formation. This transcription factor is up‐regulated under the influence of Bmp and Fgf factors. Nkx‐2.5 activates the synthesis of other transcription factors such as members of the GATA family, Mef‐2 and Hand. Nkx‐2.5 and GATAs mutually reinforce each others expression in the developing cardiac tissue. These transcription factors in turn upregulate the expression of cardiac‐specific proteins, including cardiac actin and α‐myosin. In addition, other transcription factors including Nodal and Lefty‐2 influence the pattern of asymmetry, a feature of heart formation. The transcription factor Pitx‐2, which is upregulated by Nodal, is critical for normal heart morphogenesis.
