# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts
- Vestibule

- Palatopharyngeal fold/arch
- Palatine tonsils
- Frenulum 
- maxillary bones
- palatine bones
- Muscula uvulae
- Palatoglossus
- Palatopharyngeus
- Levator palati
- Tensor Palati
- terminal sulcus
# Notes
## Surface anatomy of the oral cavity
- Vestibule
- Palatoglossal fold/arch
- Palatopharyngeal fold/arch
- Palatine tonsils
- Frenulum

## The Palate
### Hard Palate
- 4/5 maxillary bones
- 1/5 palatine bones
### Soft Palate
Contains tissues:
- glandular
- aponeurotic
- muscular

### Nerve and Blood supply to plalate
CN.VII - taste on palate
- Muscles of the palate
	- 4 innervated by vagus (CN.X)
	- 1 innervated by CN.V3


- Levator palati
	- connects to the auditory tube
	- lifts the palate
- Tensor palati
	- links to malleus
	- innervated by CN.V3 
		- weird because that is nerve of mastication muscles
		- innolved in chewing because it helps your chewing seem less loud to you
		- tension vector across palate is transverse because it pivots around the pterygold hamulus 'little hook behind nose' changing direction of it
		- tenses the palate, doens't lift it

## The Tongue
innervation from 4 pharyngeal arches
from:

1. foramen ovale
	1. V3 lingal nerve
2. CN.VII facial nerve
	1. cordatympany - via pertrotempanic fissure, then hitchhikes on to V3
3. CN.IX
4. CN.X
5. hypoglossal
	1. via between occipital condyle and foramen magnum
muscles of tongue are developed from occipital somites (see semester 1 (MD1.1))


Mapping the tongue

|               | GSA   | SVA    |
| ------------- | ----- | ------ |
| anterior 2/3  | CN.V3 | CN.VII |
| posterior 1/3 | CN.IX | CN.IX  |

Oral part

Pharyngeal part
- sensitive to gag reflex

### Tongue Muscles
All supplied by CN.VII
#### Extrinsic 
#### Intrinsic

## Floor of the mouth
### Muscles

Mylohyoid - posterior reach is right where the molar teeth are

## Salviary Glands
Three paired glands
1. parotid
2. sublingual
	1. light pink in staining => lots of mucous 
	2. close to oral cavity => lessens blocking of ducts
3. submandibular
	1. demilunes

Duct and acinar live in 'lobules'

Ducts
- intralobule vs interlobule glands
- intercalated ducts
	- unusual because nucleli pushed away from basal lateral side because of a



## Parasympathetic ganglia in H+N
there are 4, this lecture focuses on 2
otic ganglion
submandibular ganglion
