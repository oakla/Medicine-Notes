# Notes
## Coeliac Disease
- caused by gliadin intolerance (alcohol soluable faction of gluten)
- In sufferes of coeliac disease:
	- gliadin simulates IL-15 in the gut, causing 
		- NK cells to proliferate
		- 'surface markers' on epithelial cells that causes T cells to attack them
	- Villi of small bowel atrophies, thus absorptive surface is lost
- Triggers for reaction are unkown
	- HLA type seems to be a factor
### Symptoms
Symptoms are vague and protean, but **most** patients have:
- diarrhoea
- bloating or cramps
- flatulence and borborygmus
- weight loss
- fatigue
Steatorrhea is also observed in some patients

### Complications
Potential complications include most of what you might expect from a disorder that causes *malabsorption of nutrients*: 
- anaemia
- low bone density
- growth inhibition
- infertility
- amenorrhea
Skin disorders are also possible, and there is an increased risk of certain types of malignant neoplasms

### Diagnosis
- clinical history
- Serology: check for certain antibodies
	1. anti-tTG
	2. Anti-modified or deamidated gliadin antibodies (AGA)
	3. Anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA)
	4. Anti-reticulin antibodies (ARA)
- endoscopy
- histology

### Differential Diagnosis
- other food intolerances and allergies
- Crohn disease
- Tripical sprue
- Infections
- Drug reactions
- Immune system abnormalities (e.g. Autoimmune enteropathy, commoon variable immunodeficiency)
### Management
lifelong gluten free diet
dietary supplements
anti-inflammatories
monitoring for signs of complications
