Hi Maddie, 

I hope you’re doing well. 

Thank you again to you and RACGP for your continued support of GPSN.  

We’re excited to share that GPSN is organising our next event — a skills night for first- and second-year students, focused on clinical skills that are relevant for both exams and placements. We’re planning to hold this on **Wednesday 15 October, 5:30–8:30pm at the FJ Clarke Lecture Theatre, UWA**.  

The evening will begin with dinner and short presentations from 5:30pm, followed by three 45-minute stations where students can practice history taking, as well as cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal examinations. Senior students will guide and provide feedback in a safe and supportive environment. We expect around 60 MD1–2 students to attend.  

As RACGP is a silver sponsor of GPSN, I’d love to know whether RACGP would like to be involved in this event (e.g. a speaker, stall, or other contribution).  

We really appreciate your ongoing support and would be delighted to have RACGP involved again.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
