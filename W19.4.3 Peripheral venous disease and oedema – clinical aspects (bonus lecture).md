reasons and causes of fluid coming out of veins
- hydrostatic
- oncotic
- vessel leakiness (integrity of vessel wall)

People usually consider it to be cosmetic but we should think about the risk and disease it suggests

tends to be in the lower limb

ankles swell through the day. go to bed, then ankle is normal again

reduce blood pressure will reduce swelling, but don't go straight to this (understand cause first)

*most* people would get some oedema in a long haul flight

maybe due to local pathology in some situations (i.e. specific histories)
- DVT
- tumour
- some surgeries

can be so bad it blisters!

pitting oedema is a key clinical sign

non-pitting oedema 
- parasites (see slide)

pitting vs non-pitting
- hydrostatic => pitting - can be shifted by pressure
- parasites and other (non-pitting causes) - fluid can't be moved by simply pressing on the skin
