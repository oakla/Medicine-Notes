Ventral pancreas 
- originates close to the liver
- develops to be the smaller and inferior relative to the dorsal pancreas
- blood supplied by the SMA
- you can remember that the ventral pancreas (lobe from the liver) is dorsal because has the direct connection to the major duodenal papilla shared with the common bile duct

Dorsal Pancreas
- originates in the dorsal mesogastrium
- develops to be larger and superior relative to the ventral pancreas
- it's duct travels via the smaller, ventral pancreas to the major duodenal papilla
- in some people there is also a minor duodenal papilla to which its duct drains directly
