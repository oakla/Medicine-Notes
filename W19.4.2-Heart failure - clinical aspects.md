## Assessing Fluid Overload
JVP can indicate heart failure


## How do we prove its heart failure?
- think about risk factors
- don't wait for test results
- history and initial signs should help select investigations
### Selected investigations
- Transthoracic Echocardiography
	- valuable, but must be interepted in the clinical context
- Others:
	- ECG
	- chest X-ray
	- [[B-type natriuretic peptide]]
		- usually present, but increase with heart failure
		- low value can rule it out (high sensitivity)
	- exercise test
	- tests to exclude other conditions:
		- Hb, TFT, U&E, Fe studies
		- Pulmonary function tests, ...
