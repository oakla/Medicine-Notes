# Notes


## Heart Valves
There are four heart valves, each having varying but similar structure. The tissue have varying thickness, but histologically they have the same broad layer architecture. There is a dense outflow-side layer and an elastic inflow-side layer, and a core of loose connective tissue. All of which is covered with endothelium.

The layers of heart valve tissue  
- Outer endothelium lining  
- Fibrosa – dense collagenous layer, close to outflow surface  
- Spongiosa – central core of loose connective tissue  
- Ventricularis/atrialis – elastin layer below inflow surface

## VHD Categories
### Valvular stenosis
Narrowing with failure to open completely thereby impeding forward flow
### Valvular incompetence
Failure to close properly thereby allowing reversed flow
- Stenosis and incompetence can co-exist
- More than one valve may be involved
- May be detected clinically as abnormal heart sounds or murmurs
