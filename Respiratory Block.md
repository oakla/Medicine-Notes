[[MD1.2 Test 1 Formative Review]]
# Tasks

## From Marcus' wrap up lecture
[[Environmental lung disease]]
Chronic lung disease (e.g. COPD, pulmonary fibrosis)
- Compare and contrast [[Obstructive and Restrictive Lung Diseases]]
	- Recognise and explain obstructive and restrictive patterns based on lung function tests and clinical/pathological findings
- Define and describe [[COPD]] and the specific diseases that are included in this category
	- Describe characteristics of COPD in regards to the following:
	- Patterns of airway obstruction
	- Main pathological findings
	- Risk factors and co-morbidities that can contribute to the development of COPD and its exacerbation
### Restrictive and Obstructive lung diseases ….
Minimum:
- Recognise obstructive pattern and restrictive pattern on LFTs.
- Know the main diseases for each category.
- COPD (CB and emphysema) are common.
- Asthma is common.
- Other obstructive diseases less common.

#### Interstitial lung disease
As a category, it is common. BUT, each individual disease in this category is relatively uncommon. 
- What are the key examples? see lecture
They all vary in incidence and specific clinical features, radiology, pathology, and management.


### Neoplasms

Classificaion: Do you know the following tumours (risk factors, morphology, principles of staging/grading/major subtypes)?
- Lung: Small cell, Non-small cell (squamous cell Ca, AdenoCa, undifferentiated, other), carcinoid
- Pleura: Mesothelioma
- [Other (sarcomas, leukaemia/lymphoma/myeloma, etc)]
Key aspects for diagnosis and management.
- Symptoms and signs: when to consider lung Ca
Primary vs metastasis
- Management and presentation differences for different subtypes
- Making a diagnosis - testing

### Respiratory infections

Describe characteristics of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in regards to the following:
- Risk factors and co-morbidities that can contribute to the development of CAP
- The common pathogens
- Clinical presentation including relevant aspects of history and examination.
- Common pathological patterns (bronchopneumonia, lobar pneumonia, tuberculosis, abscesses)
- Discuss the protection, prevention and treatment strategies in regards to community-acquired pneumonia

### Asthma
Could you:
- Define asthma. Include a description of the change in structure and function of respiration in asthma including the clinical features (signs and symptoms).
- Outline some potential triggers/risk factors (avoidable & unavoidable triggers).
- Describe the pathological features in acute and chronic asthma

### Macro examples in the SGL:
- Tuberculosis (different forms, do you understand why they occur?)
- Lung infarcts and pulmonary embolus
- Bronchiectasis
- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s)
- MIXED cases – multiple pathologies co-existing are common in lung disease due to shared aetiologies (e.g. smoking, pneumoconiosis) or problems that arise secondary to an earlier problem (e.g. obstruction due to carcinoma causing pneumonia)
### Background basic pathological knowledge (sem 1 stuff)
To understand the entities on the previous slides you need to review and understand (well):
- Hypersensitivity reactions
	- *GPA*
	- *pulmonary fibrosis*
- How cancers develop
	- *knudson hypothesis*
	- 'more than just angiogenesis'
		- learn what the cells themselve are doing
- Bacterial and viral infections, bacteraemia, tuberculosis, immunocompromise
- Interplay between genetics and environment in aetiology of lung disease
