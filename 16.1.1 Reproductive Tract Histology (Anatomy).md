# Notes

## Female
### Ovary
- Ovary
	- main parts: tunica albuginea, cortex, medulla and hilum
	- tunica albuginea is a covering of the gonads in both males and females, but in females it is much thinner so that oocytes can bust through (be secreted)
	- blood vessels enter through the hilum
	- the medulla is mostly blood vessels (but also scar tissue from 'old follicles' (corpus albicans))
	- all the **follicles** are found in the cortex
#### Follicles
Follicles have stages of development (can be grouped into 2 main types: without an antrum and *with* antrum: 
- **without** antrum (2):
	1. ==**primordial** follicle== - contains:
		- **primary oocyte** surround by a **single layer of squamosal granulosa cells**
		- granulosa cells produce eostrogen and inhib
	2. ==**primary** follicle== - a development from the primordial follicle:
		- granulosa cells changes:
			- become cuboidal (from squamous)
			- multi-layered if older
		- addition of ==thecal cells== - stromal cells on the perimeter
		- ==zona pellucida== - glycoprotein layer secreted by, and surrounding the oocyte
- **with** an antrum
	3. ==**secondary** / antral follicle==
		- **antrum** is filled with fluid secreted by granulosa cells. this fluid is a 'storage pool' of eostrogen and inhib
		- addition of a Cumulus oophorus (a thicker layer of granulosa cells that's kind of like the 'stalk' attaching the oocyte and it's surronding granulosa cells to the wall of granulosa cells that make up the wall of the follicle)
##### The tertiary follicle
- Once per cycle, one secondary follicle becomes a ==**tertiary** follicle== (addition of the 'corona radiata')
- ruptures to release the oocyte (i.e ovulation) and becomes a corpus luteum (a transient endocrine organ)
- the ==corpus luteum==
	- secretes progesterone, eostradiol and inhibin A
	- if no pregnancy the corpus luteum (sometimes) becomes a ==corpus albicans== (scar tissue in the ovary)
### The Uterine tube
4 sections, from uterus to 'egg catcher': 
1. intramural, 
2. isthmus, 
3. ampulla, 
4. infundibulum / fibria
The mucosal folds in the tube 
- increase in complexity towards the infundibulum
- change through out menstral cycle
- help to transport and nurture the oocyte

The layers of the uterine tube wall are:
- epithelium:
	- made of ciliated cells and secretory (peg) cells (both are columnar)
- Muscularis externa: 
	- inner circular
	- outer longitudinal layers
- Serosa
### Uterus
3 layers of the uterus wall are:
1. Endometrium
	1. Stramum basale / Basal layer
	2. Stratum functionale / Function layer: sloughed during menstral cycle
2. Myometrium: Thick smooth muscle layer
3. Perimetrium: Outer serosal layer

### Cervix 
- functions:
	- holds the baby in
	- regulates transport of sperm from vagina to uterus (via the endocervical canal)
- endocervical canal
	- lined by simple columnar epithelium
	- surface invaginates to form cervical glands
### Vagina

- lined by stratified squamous epithelium
	- epithelial cells produce lactic acid and glycogen when borken down by (good) bacteria
- rugae folds in the mucosa allow for distention
- muscularis externa of smooth muscle
- Voluntary muscle of bulbospongiosus at vaginal orifice

## Male

### Testes and Ducts
Between testes and scrotum is a double layered a serous membrane called the ==tunica vaginalis== (outer **parietal** layer lines the inside of the scrotum and the inner **visceral** layer covers the testis)
From sperm production to leaving the testes:
1. Semniferous tubules
	1. produce sperm
2. Rete testis
	1. funneling network 
	2. reduciton of many semniferous tubules into fewer efferent ductules
3. Efferent ductules
	1. fluid reabsorption
4. Epididymis
	1. sperm maturation and transport
5. Vas deferens
	1. sperm transport and storage

Tunica Albuginea around the testes 
- thicker than the tunica albuginea around the female gonads
- Semniferous tubules are grouped into lobules by septa made from projections of the tunica albuginea extending into the testes

### From sperm production to Prostate
#### Semniferous tubules
- tunica proria wrapped around tubules
- Site of gametogenesis
	- development procedes as the germ cells develop
		- spermatogonia => primary spermatocytes =>
		- should be 'spermatozoa' by the time they reach the lumen (spermatozoa are motile (have a tail))
- sertoli cells
	- create a Blood testis barrier (BTB) by having tight junctions with one another near the basal membrane of the tubule
	- remove waste by extending to lumen
	- communicate with Leydig cells
- Leydig cells
	- secrete androgens
	- are found in the interstial space between tubules
#### Rete testis
- transition between semniferous tubules to efferent ductules
#### Efferent ductules
- absorption and transport
- Pseudostratified columnar epithelium
	- ciliated cells
	- absorbtive cells
- ductules converge to form the epididymis

#### Epididymis
- Pseudostratified epithelium with
	- Principal cells (PC): Tall with large microvilli / *stereocilia*
		- Secrete factors that hide sperm cells from the immune system
	- Basal cells (BC): support cells (not stem cells)
#### Vas deferens
- sperm transport and storage
- Travels:
	1. from epididymis
	2. passes through inguinal canal
	3. Superior and medial to ureters, 
	4. posterior to bladder
	5. Converge with the ==seminal vesciles== and to form the ejaculatory ducts (which then join the urethra inside the **prostate**)
#### Seminal vesicles
- provides 65-70% of seminal volume
- produces an 'Alkaline colloid' 

#### Prostate
- receives input from the vas deferens and seminal vesicles via the ejaculatory duct
- contributes 25-35% of seminal volume
- 3 distinct zones
	- anterior fibromuscular
	- cnetral
	- peripheral
#### Bulbourethral gland
- paired gland
- below prostate
- Produce and release **pre-ejaculatory fluid** - an alkaline lubricant that assists sperm by neutralising pH in the vagina
- penetrate the perineal membrane and **open into the urethra**
