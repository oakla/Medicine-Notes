# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections
- Histology of the female reproductive tract
	- Ovary
- Histology of the male reproductive tract

## Key Terms & Concepts
- Ovary
- corpus luteum

# Notes

- Ovary
	- main parts: tunica albuginea, cortex, medulla and hilum
	- tunica albuginea is a covering of the gonads in both males and females, but in females it is much thinner so that oocytes can bust through (be secreted)
	- blood vessels enter through the hilum
	- the medulla is mostly blood vessels (but also scar tissue from 'old follicles' (corpus albicans))
	- all the **follicles** are found in the cortex
## Follicles
Follicles have stages of development (can be grouped into 2 main types: without an antrum and *with* antrum: 
- **without** antrum (2):
	1. ==**primordial** follicle== - contains:
		- **primary oocyte** surround by a **single layer of squamosal granulosa cells**
		- granulosa cells produce eostrogen and inhib
	2. ==**primary** follicle== - a development from the primordial follicle:
		- granulosa cells changes:
			- become cuboidal (from squamous)
			- multi-layered if older
		- addition of ==thecal cells== - stromal cells on the perimeter
		- ==zona pellucida== - glycoprotein layer secreted by, and surrounding the oocyte
- **with** an antrum
	3. ==**secondary** / antral follicle==
		- **antrum** is filled with fluid secreted by granulosa cells. this fluid is a 'storage pool' of eostrogen and inhib
		- addition of a Cumulus oophorus (a thicker layer of granulosa cells that's kind of like the 'stalk' attaching the oocyte and it's surronding granulosa cells to the wall of granulosa cells that make up the wall of the follicle)

### The tertiary follicle
- Once per cycle, one secondary follicle becomes a ==**tertiary** follicle== (addition of the 'corona radiata')
- ruptures to release the oocyte (i.e ovulation) and becomes a corpus luteum (a transient endocrine organ)
- the ==corpus luteum==
	- secretes progesterone, eostradiol and inhibin A
	- if no pregnancy it becomes a ==corpus albicans==
