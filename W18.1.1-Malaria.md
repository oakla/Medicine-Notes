"What are the signs of severe malaria"
- shock
- renal failure
- low platelets


- Transmission rates and partial immunity determines clinical pattern of disease
- High endemicity – childhood severe disease/mortality, no clinical disease in adults
- Low endemicity – adult severe disease
- Returned travellers/VFF – no immunity, like ‘low endemicity’
- Presents with a febrile illness syndrome – not easy to  differentiate from other causes
- P. falciparum vs. P. vivax (other species less important)
- Rural, not urban
- Artemisinin therapies, RDT, Insecticide treated bednets & Vaccine are the main tools

Sections
- epidemiology
- clinical features

+++ light microscopy
+++ rapid diagnostic tests (RDT)
++ molecular
