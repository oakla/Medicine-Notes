# Notes
all stomach
## Secretions
3 types of *exocrione* gland cells:
- mucous neck cells 
- parietal cells (intrinsic factor and HCl)
- chief cells (pepsinogen and gastric lipase[^1])
2 types of *endocrine* glands cells (and maybe more?)
- G-cell => gastrin => increase activity 
- D-cell => somatostatin => decrease activity

Not much point producing secreting acid in the stomach near the stomach exit. Acid is made in the top part

## stomach motor activity
- Food enters
	- stomach stretch triggers reflexes that relax stomach muscles
	- intinsic and vago-vagal
- mixing and grinding
	- pyloric sphincter closes during this process
		- opens carefully to slowly introduce food to duodenum
		- duodenum feedbacks signals to stomach that control pyloric sphincter
			- CCK
			- secretin
			- signals triggered by several factors (distension, pH, fat)
		- somewhat (less of) controlled by CNS signals too
