Stomach
3 types of *exocrione* gland cells:
- mucous neck cells 
- parietal cells (intrinsic factor and HCl)
- chief cells (pepsinogen and gastric lipase[^1])
2 types of *endocrine* glands cells (and maybe more?)
- G-cell => gastrin => increase activity 
- D-cell => somatostatin => decrease activity

Not much point producing digest enzymes in the stomach near the stomach exit
