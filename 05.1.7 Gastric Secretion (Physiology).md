# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts
- metering input duodenum
	- pyloric sphincter control
		- vago-vagal reflex
- 

# Notes
all stomach

- 4 regions; cardia, fundus, corpus (body), antrum
## Gastric Glands & Secretions
3 types of *exocrione* gland cells:
- mucous neck cells 
- parietal cells (intrinsic factor and HCl)
- chief cells (pepsinogen and gastric lipase[^1])
2 types of *endocrine* glands cells (and maybe more?)
- G-cell => gastrin => increase activity 
- D-cell => somatostatin => decrease activity

Not much point producing secreting acid in the stomach near the stomach exit. Acid is made in the top part

## stomach motor activity
- active relaxation - makes space for food
	- Food enters
		- stomach stretch triggers reflexes that relax stomach muscles
		- intrinsic and vago-vagal reflex
- mixing and grinding
	- pyloric sphincter closes during this process
	- regulated by stretch, ANS, osmo-receptors

- Pyloric sphincter opening
	- opens carefully to slowly introduce food to duodenum
	- duodenum feedback is largest influence on pyloric sphincter opening
		- signals; CCK, secretin
		- triggers: distension, pH, fat, amino acids, hypertonicity
		- pathways: short (intrinsic?) and 'long neural reflexex'
	- somewhat (less of) controlled by CNS signals too
### Vomiting
- regulated by CNS
- many possible triggers: upper GIT irritation, limbic system (emotions), blood chemicals (affecting medullary area postrema chem-receptors)

### Histology
- glands hidden/protected with 'gastric pits'
	- protective cells at top (i.e mucous cells)
	- mucous neck cells secerte alkaline mucous


# Questions

## My Questions
- are gastric pits the same thing as secretory sheaths?
