# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
1. Understand the key similarities and differences between pathologies at different sites, including examples of diseases that affect multiple parts of the GIT â€“ understand how diseases reflect abnormalities of the anatomy, histology and physiology in different locations
2. Discuss and evaluate the common signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal tract disease
3. Demonstrate a rational approach to understanding aetiology and differential diagnosis of common lesions and presentations in the gastrointestinal tract
4. Discuss the significance of dysplasia in the gastrointestinal tract
5. Discuss key clinicopathological features of specified gastrointestinal diseases (in this lecture: appendicitis, bowel obstruction, basics of congenital anomalies)

## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes

## Types of Aetiology
**VITAMIN CD**
### Vascular
- rupture or obstruction of blood vessels
- obstruction of bowel can congest venous vessels
### Inflammatory/ infective
#### Infective
- specific pathogenic organisms tend to cause disease at a specific gut site
- damage to epithelium can lead to septicaemia
#### Inflammatory
- Non-infective causes: autoimmune, drugs (lots of them)
- example; **appendicitis**
	- aeitiology: obstruction of the lumen allows bacteria to multiply
### Trauma
### Autoimmune
### Metabolic/endocrine
### Iatrogenic/ idiopathic
### Neoplastic / other growth disorders
### Congenital / genetic
### Degenerative

## Obstruction
- cause or result of the above aeitologies
- some common causes
	- Herniation
	- Adhesions
	- Intussusception
	- Volvulus
