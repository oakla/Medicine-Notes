# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts

### Major
- Diabetes – Type 1
- Diabetes – Type 2
- To be covered more in clinical years:
	- Hypoglycaemia
	- Diabetic ketoacidosis
	- Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state
### Minor
- neoplastic legions of the endocrine pancreas
- dispersed endocrine system and its common neoplastic legions

### Specifics

* **Islets of Langerhans**: β (insulin), α (glucagon), δ (somatostatin), PP (pancreatic polypeptide); minor cells D1 (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, VIP) and enterochromaffin (serotonin). 
* **Diabetes diagnosis**: fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L; 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) ≥11.1 mmol/L; glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥6.5%; random glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L with symptoms. 
* **Classification**: type 1 diabetes (autoimmune β-cell destruction), type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance → β-cell dysfunction), impaired glucose tolerance, gestational diabetes, and **other specific causes** (drugs, endocrinopathies, exocrine pancreas disease, monogenic syndromes). **Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)** discussed.    
* **Pathogenesis highlights**:
  • T1D - HLA-DR3/DR4, loss of T-cell tolerance to islet antigens → β-cell destruction.
  • T2D - genetics + visceral adiposity; free fatty acids, adipokines, inflammation drive insulin resistance → β-cell failure.
  • Gestational diabetes - pregnancy-related intolerance, macrosomia risk; usually resolves post-delivery.   
* **Acute complications**: diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS), hypoglycaemia.   
* **Chronic complications & mechanisms**: macroangiopathy (atherosclerosis → ischaemic heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease), microangiopathy (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy); mechanisms include advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), protein kinase C (PKC), oxidative stress/polyol, hexosamine pathway.   
* **Diabetic nephropathy**: nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel–Wilson), diffuse mesangial sclerosis, glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening; plus renal vascular and tubular lesions. 
* **Infection susceptibility**: impaired neutrophil/macrophage function and blood supply → ↑ skin/mucosal/urinary infections. 
* **Neuroendocrine system & tumours**: dispersed neuroendocrine cells across organs; islet cell growth disorders and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) including insulinoma and gastrinoma; multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) associations.   


## Essentials

S5- Pancreatic islets contain cells th four dominant cell types with distinct hormones: 
- β (insulin ↓ blood glucose), 

S10 - Diabetes Mellitus is a family of metabolic disorders unified by hyperglycaemia. It is common.

There are four metrics for diagnosis in order of decreasing accuracy:
1. fasting plasma glucose, 
2. oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), 
3. HbA1c,
4. Random plasma glucose

S12 - Classifications
- Type 1 
	- autoimmune beta-cell destruction
	- usually onset < 20 yoa but there is adult onset (type 1.5 aka LADA)
- Type 2 
	- insulin resistance
	- preceded by elevated plasma glucose (below diagnostic range) - 25% will go on to develop T2DM within 5 years
- Gestational diabetes
	- diabetes in the mother during pregnancy
	- diabetes either appeared during pregnancy or prior 
- Others. Many causes, but important ones are:
	- drugs. mostly endocrine/hormonal ones
	- endocrinopathies
	- monogenic diabetes syndrome

# Notes

**1) Normal endocrine pancreas (Slide 5)**
Islets contain four dominant cell types with distinct hormones: 
- β (insulin ↓ blood glucose), 
- α (glucagon ↑ glucose), 
- δ (somatostatin suppresses insulin/glucagon), 
- PP (pancreatic polypeptide affects gut enzymes/motility). 

Two minor types: 
- D1 (Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), induces glycogenolysis and hyperglycaemia)) 
- enterochromaffin (serotonin). 

**2) Diabetes - definition & diagnosis (Slide 10)**
Diabetes is a family of metabolic disorders unified by hyperglycaemia, diagnosed by one of the following in order of decreasing accuracy:
1. fasting plasma glucose, 
2. oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), 
3. HbA1c,
4. Random plasma glucose 
Key point: Random plasma glucose is a last resort (in very unwell patients) - confirm with one of the other three once patient is stable.

**3) Classification (Slides 12–13)**
Type 1 (autoimmune, usually younger onset), 
- LADA (aka type 1.5) is discussed as slower-onset autoimmune diabetes in adults; often mislabelled as type 2 initially.   
Type 2 (insulin resistance on a metabolic syndrome background), 
- begins with impaired glucose tolerance, 
gestational diabetes,  
“other specific causes”
- drugs. mostly endocrine/hormonal ones
- endocrinopathies, 
- exocrine pancreatic disease, 
- monogenic. 

**4) Clinical features (Slides 16–17)**
Type 1 often has a silent prodrome then abrupt decompensation with polyuria/polydipsia/polyphagia and risk of DKA; type 2 may be mild, intermittent, or asymptomatic and can progress to HHS when severe. Take-away: severity and tempo differ; always consider both hypo- and hyperglycaemia in altered consciousness.   

**5) Pathogenesis (Slides 19–21)**
Type 1: genetic susceptibility (HLA-DR3/DR4) + environmental triggers → T-cell autoimmunity against islet antigens → β-cell destruction. Type 2: obesity/adipose signalling (free fatty acids, adipokines, cytokines) drives insulin resistance; β-cells later fail. Gestational diabetes increases macrosomia and later-life metabolic risk; typically resolves after delivery. Take-away: immune vs metabolic origins, both culminating in inadequate insulin action.    

**6) Pathological findings (Slide 24)**
Type 1 shows insulitis and islet cell loss; type 2 shows islet amyloid deposition with milder depletion. In practice, diabetes is diagnosed clinically/biochemically, not by biopsy. Take-away: recognise the hallmark patterns; they explain organ failure over time.   

**7) Consequences - acute (Slides 27–28)**
DKA (mostly type 1): insulin deficiency + counter-regulatory surge → hyperglycaemia, dehydration, ketogenesis, acidosis; treat insulin deficit, acidosis, and triggers. HHS (mostly type 2): profound dehydration with minimal/no ketosis. Hypoglycaemia: overtreatment; always check in drowsy patients. Take-away: emergencies map to the underlying pathophysiology.   

**8) Consequences - chronic & mechanisms (Slides 29–34)**
Hyperglycaemia damages vessels via AGEs, PKC, oxidative/polyol, and hexosamine pathways → macroangiopathy (atherosclerosis: ischaemic heart disease, stroke, limb ischaemia) and microangiopathy (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) that potentiate each other; infections are more common. Take-away: vascular biology is the exam magnet.    

**9) Diabetic nephropathy (Slides 35–36)**
Classic spectrum: diffuse and nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel–Wilson), GBM thickening; renal vascular disease (microangiopathy, atherosclerosis) and tubular lesions (pyelonephritis, papillary necrosis; rare Armanni–Ebstein change). Take-away: learn the list cold - common exam territory.   

**10) Neuroendocrine system & islet NETs (Slides 41–49)**
Neuroendocrine cells are widely dispersed; similar tumours arise across organs. Pancreatic NETs are rare, small, sometimes MEN1-associated, and may be functional (insulinoma → episodic hypoglycaemia; gastrinoma → refractory ulcers/diarrhoea; VIPoma, glucagonoma, somatostatinoma). Take-away: recognise syndrome-tumour pairs and MEN1 links.
