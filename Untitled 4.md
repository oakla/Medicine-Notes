**Vote Alex for Mature Chair

Here for the not-straight-out-of-high-school crowd

Hi! I’m Alex and I’m nominating for Mature Chair. I know the struggle of juggling life and study and I want WAMSS to work for all of us, not just those with free Tuesday afternoons.

I’ll:
* **Champion** mature-age voices at every meeting.
* **Support** a peer network for career-changers and return-to-study students
* **Advocate** for time-table clarity and quality lecture recordings

**Let’s make med school work for grown-ups. Vote Alex.**
