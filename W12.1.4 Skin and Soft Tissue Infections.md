Most common causes of skin infection:
- Bacterial Pathogens:
	- Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA): The most common pathogen responsible for skin infections, including cellulitis, abscesses, impetigo, and folliculitis.
	- Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Strep): Causes cellulitis, impetigo, erysipelas, and necrotizing fasciitis and Other beta-haemolytic streptococci: S.dysgalactiae (Group C/G), S.agalactiae (Group B – more common diabetics/elderly)

- Fungal Pathogens (most common):
	- Candida and related species: Cause superficial infections like thrush and diaper rashes, as well as skin folds infections (intertrigo).
	- Dermatophytes (e.g., Trichophyton, Microsporum, Epidermophyton): Cause tinea infections (e.g., ringworm, athlete’s foot).
	- Malassezia – pityriasis versicolor
