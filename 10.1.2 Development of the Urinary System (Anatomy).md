# Urinary System Development — Key Concepts (MD1)

## Big Picture

* **Theme:** Human renal development mirrors vertebrate evolution (pro→meso→metanephros) and is tightly linked to reproductive tract development.
* **Clinical anchor:** Fetal renal function drives amniotic fluid volume; deviations produce multisystem consequences.
---
## Embryologic Origins

* **Source tissue:** Kidneys, ureters, and much of the lower urinary tract derive from the **intermediate mesoderm (IMM)** of the urogenital ridge. (Adrenal cortex largely from lateral plate mesoderm.)
* **Segmental plan:** IMM forms **nephrotomes** (cranial→caudal), setting up three kidney “generations.”
---
## Three “Kidneys” (Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny)

### 1) **Pronephros** (cervical; week \~4 → regresses by week \~5)
* Non-functional in humans; likely a signaling scaffold for the mesonephric duct.
### 2) **Mesonephros** (thoracic/lumbar; appears end of week 4)
* Produces small amounts of “urine” **weeks 6–12** drained via the **mesonephric duct**, into the cloaca, thus keeping the mesonephric duct patent.
* Thoracic segments regress from **week 5**; lumbar segments persist to **weeks 10–12**.
* Architecture favors **smaller glomeruli + larger tubules** → filtration with **reabsorption** 
	* larger tubules allow for (more) reabsorption, a preadaption to terrestial life
### 3) **Metanephros** — the definitive kidney (sacral origin)
- Most of the **definitive kidney** (glomeruli and nephron tubules up to the DCT)
	* **Ureteric bud (metanephric duct)** sprouts from the **dorsal mesonephric duct** at **week 5** → induces adjacent IMM to become **metanephric mesenchyme** (nephrons: glomeruli + tubules).
* Drainage system (collecting ducts → calyces → pelvis → ureter)
	* Ureteric bud repeatedly bifurcates → **collecting system** (collecting ducts → calyces → pelvis → ureter).
* **Division of labor:**
  * Ureteric bud = **drainage/collecting system**
  * Metanephric mesenchyme = **nephron (pre-collecting duct) structures**

## Fetal Kidney Function & Amniotic Fluid
* **Urine appears:** early mesonephric output by **week 6**; **metanephric urine by week \~12**.
* By **week \~16**, kidneys are the **primary source** of amniotic fluid. Adequate fluid requires functioning kidneys and patent outflow.
* **Consequence of low amniotic fluid** (Oligohydramnios): 
	* pulmonary hypoplasia → neonatal RDS; 
	* gut hypomotility/feeding issues; 
	* malrotation of intestines; 
	* issues from compression (e.g. MSk, facial, growth restrction)

---
## Kidney Ascent & Vascular Remodeling
* **Ascent begins in week 6** 
	* metanephric kidney 
		* coexists with *meso*nephros
		* **retroperitoneal**
		* is **dorsal** to mesonephric duct and gonad.
* **Arterial pattern:** 
	* as the kidneys ascend, cranially they “acquire” successive lateral branches from the aorta 
	* caudal branches are **sequentially pruned** (
	* results in 5 or fewer persisting; more than 5 is atypical
* **Venous pattern:** 
	* climbs over “ladder-like” **subcardinal system** (leftover mesonephric scaffold).
	* Obliteration of the ladder-like subcardinal system:
		* left side in obliterated, leaving IVC on right side
		* explains asymmetry
- left renal 
	- drains left adrenal, renal and gonad
	- longer because it must travel over the aorta to attach to the IVC 
	- travels under the SMA => creates 'nutcracker vulnerability'
---
## Adult Position & Relations (Clinical Patterns)

* **Primary retroperitoneal**; embedded in **perirenal fat → renal fascia → pararenal fat**.
* Poles at **ribs 11–12**; **right kidney lower** (liver).
* **Hilum (anterior→posterior):** **Vein → Artery → Ureter (V→A→U)**.
* **Left renal vein** 
	* may be compressed (nutcracker); 
	* longer due to venous remodeling. 
* *These are patterns, not absolute rules.*
---
## Developmental Anomalies (High-Yield)
* **Horseshoe kidney (\~1/500):** fusion at lower poles; ascent arrested by **IMA**.
* Conditions that reduce amniotic fluid volume
	* Reduction in nephron numbe or drainager: 
		* Hypoplasia (\~1/400) 
		* unilateral agenesis (\~1/1000–2000)
	* **Outflow anomalies:** 
		* duplicated ureters (duplicated buds)
		* ureteric obstruction
		* malpartition of major calyces (should be 3 for balanced drainage)
---
## Bladder & Trigone Development
* **Cloaca** is mostly hindgut-derived
* The **uro-rectal** septum 
	* **partitions the cloaca** into:
		* Urogenital sinus (anterior) → bladder + urethra
		* Anorectal canal (posterior) → rectum + anal canal
	* IMM drevied 
* **Trigone**: 
	* triangular area at the base of the bladder, between the two ureteric orifices and the urethral opening
	* derivative of the mesonephric ducts (IMM), incorporated into the bladder wall
* Allantois
	* becomes bladder + urachus (median umbilical ligament) if it obliterates normally
	* if urachus does not obliterate, can result in:
		* Urachal fistula - full connection
		- Urachal sinus - really deep belly button
		- Urachal cyst - lump/cyst in umbilical ligament

## Key Timelines (Exam-friendly)
* **Wk 4:** Pronephros appears (cervical).
* **Wk \~5:** Pronephros regresses; **ureteric bud** sprouts; thoracic mesonephros begins to regress.
* **Wk 6:** Mesonephros producing small volumes; **kidney ascent begins**; cloacal septation.
* **Wks 6–12:** Mesonephros drains via mesonephric duct.
* **Wks 10–12:** Lumbar mesonephros regresses; **metanephric urine** present by \~12.
* **Wk \~16:** Kidneys = **primary** amniotic fluid source.
* **By 12 wks:** Anal canal, vagina, urethra present (context for cloacal partitioning).

## High-Yield Associations & Clinical Correlates

* **Renal–gonadal relationship:** shared mesonephric scaffolding explains parallel development and final anatomic relations (e.g., gonadal vessels).
* **Retroperitoneal ascent** explains crossing patterns and variable segmental vascular supply (arteries “picked up” en route).
* **Low amniotic fluid** (Oligohydramnios sequence): think airway, gut, growth, face, limbs. Manage by identifying **renal output** or **outflow obstruction** issues.

## Quick Check (self-test prompts)

* **What tissues form the collecting system vs. nephron?**
* **Why is the left renal vein longer and often anterior to the aorta?**
* **When does the kidney start contributing most to amniotic fluid?**
* **Which vessel halts ascent in a horseshoe kidney?**
* **What’s the embryologic origin of the trigone vs. the rest of the bladder mucosa?**


## Tom's Summary
Kidney development begins in the cervical spine, continuing down the vertebral column, until the definitive metanephric kidney
develops in the sacral region. It ascends a ladder-like system of vasculature that pre-existed because of the mesonephros, which
helps to explain some of the patterns seen in adult anatomy – both normal and abnormal. How the mesonephros changes with
time also plays a key role in reproductive development.
- The ureter is IMM derived, as it sprouts from the dorsal aspect of the mesonephric duct, inducing the surrounding IMM to
become metanephric mesenchyme – creating the definitive kidney.
- Ureteric/metanephric bud = ‘drainage aspect’ = collecting ducts down ureter
- Metanephric mesenchyme = structure of the kidney, including nephron components pre-collecting duct.
- The fetal kidney is not idle, ‘urine’ is made from week 6 and metanephric urine become primarily contributor to amniotic fluid
volume from week 16. Making amniotic fluid volume a measure of kidney function, where low urine output becomes a
multisystem issue.
- Being primary retroperitoneal, the kidney ascends dorsally to most other things, creating important anatomical relationships, in
terms of what crosses in front/behind of what. It sits within its own fascia, surrounded by a large amount of fat.
- The ureter has a complex blood/nerve supply, reflecting its ontogeny, with the upper ureter being similar in supply to the kidneys
and the lower ureter being similar to the bladder, with everything in between being a bit of a mix.
- The bladder being derived from the hindgut creates a pattern that can be used to understand its general structure, and how if the
urorectal septum could splice the two systems incorrectly – leading to fistulas and alike
