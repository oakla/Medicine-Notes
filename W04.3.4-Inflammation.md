# Notes
- 8 steps
1. trigger
2. Chemoattractants are released
	- Cytokines like IL-8
	- Complement proteins like C5a
	- Arachidonic acid metabolites like leukotriene B4
	- Also -Bacterial elements are chemoattractant in themselves
3. Leukocytes are attracted
4. Blood vessels dilate
5. Emigration
	1. leukocyte 'rolls' out of the cell
6. Activation of leukocytes
7. phagocytosis
	1. lysomes dumped on it from inside
8. Opsonisation
	1. proteins coated onto microbe (antibodies and complement components (e.g. C3b))
