| 1   | What does Mendel’s First Law (Segregation) state?                                                                  | A. Genes always come in dominant pairs<br>B. Each gamete receives both alleles<br>C. Each gamete receives one allele for each gene<br>D. Linked genes segregate together<br>E. Chromosomes assort independently | Think of meiosis: alleles separate into gametes.            | C      |
| 2   | Which inheritance pattern shows affected individuals in every generation, with equal male and female distribution? | A. X-linked recessive<br>B. Autosomal recessive<br>C. Mitochondrial<br>D. Autosomal dominant<br>E. Y-linked                                                                                                     | No skipping of generations and both sexes equally affected. | D      |
| 3   | Why are mitochondrial disorders often heteroplasmic?                                                               | A. Due to maternal nuclear influence<br>B. Mitochondria recombine<br>C. Mitochondria replicate independently<br>D. Only occur in adulthood<br>E. Cells contain a mix of normal and variant mtDNA                | mtDNA is not evenly distributed in daughter cells.          | E      |
| 4   | A male with an X-linked dominant disorder has children. Who will inherit the trait?                                | A. Only his sons<br>B. Only his daughtersC. Both sons and daughtersD. NeitherE. Only carriers                                                                                                                   | Fathers give their X to daughters only.                     | B      |
| 5   | Which term describes a condition where two or more genotypically different cell lines exist in one individual?     | A. AneuploidyB. HeterozygosityC. MosaicismD. PolymorphismE. Pleiotropy                                                                                                                                          | Think post-zygotic mutation.                                | C      |
| 6   | In codominance, how do alleles interact?                                                                           | A. One masks the otherB. Traits blendC. One is silentD. Both traits are expressed equallyE. Neither is expressed                                                                                                | Think ABO blood group (e.g., IA/IB = AB).                   | D      |
| 7   | What is pleiotropy?                                                                                                | A. One gene, one traitB. Many genes, one traitC. One gene influences multiple traitsD. Traits blend across allelesE. X-linked inheritance                                                                       | Think sickle cell or cystic fibrosis.                       | C      |
| 8   | What is the genotype of a female carrier of an X-linked recessive trait?                                           | A. XⁿXⁿB. XYC. XⁿXD. XⁿYE. XX                                                                                                                                                                                   | One normal, one affected X.                                 | C      |
