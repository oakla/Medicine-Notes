"Easily testable facts"
- Escherichia coli (specifically, UPEC) most common cause of UTI
- Staphylococcus saprophyticus (supposedly) a cause of UTI in young adult females ("honeymoon cystitis")
- Staph aureus and candida spp in urine might indicate bloodstream infection
- Which common uropathogens produce nitrate reductase (E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp), and which do not (Staphylococcus spp, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus faecalis)
- Standard threshold for bacterial growth reporting in urine is â‰¥10*8 colony forming units (CFU)/L
- Some antibiotics (nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin) are good for cystitis, but inappropriate for pyelonephritis etc because they don't reach adequate concentration in kidney tissue/blood

Long Answer Qs
- Describe the pathophysiology of UTI and how it relates to risk factors for UTI
- Describe the indications for treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and reasons why
