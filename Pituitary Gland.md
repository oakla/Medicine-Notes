## Important Concepts and things to know
- hypthalamic hypophyseal portal vessels
- hypothalamic hypophyseal tract


## 
**The anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis, cerebral hypophysis)**
- is made of epithelial glandular tissue (link to development)
- Has 3 sub-components
	- **Pars tuberalis** : 
		- wrapped around infundibulum
		- Mostly basophilic cells secreting:
			- Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)
			- Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
			- Luteinising hormone (LH)
	- **Pars distalis**
		- Largest part of the pituitary
		- Acidophils secrete: Growth hormone (GH) & prolactin
		- Basophils secrete: ACTH, FSH, LH & thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
	- **Pars intermedia**
		- Mostly basophils that secrete melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH)
			- Can have colloid (fluid-filled) cysts = remnant of Rathkeâ€™s pouch
