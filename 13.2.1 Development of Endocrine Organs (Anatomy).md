## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts

## My Summary

the lecture lightly covers the development of 6 endocrine organs; pineal, pituitary (ant and post), thyroid, parathyroid, pancreas, and adreanals

For each, the lecture mentions organ components and embryonic tissue of origin for each of those. Components of several glands arise from the pharyngeal pouches (interior spaces between pharyngeal arches)

1. The pineal originates from NT ectoderm (dorsal side)
2. Pituitary:
	- anterior develops from rathke's pouch, an invagination of the surface ectoderm of the primordial mouth (!)
	- posterior develops from ventral NT ectoderm
3. Thyroid
	1. bulk of the thyroid comes from the throid diverticulum of the pharynx
	2. thyroid diverticulum forms in floor of pharynx (opening to diverticulum is called the *foramen caecum*)
	3. Diverticulum buds and migrates to thyroid cartilage
	4. Also: C-cells of thyroid gland come from 4th pharyngeal arch
4. Parathyroid gland
	1. Superior PT gland comes from 4th pharyngeal pouch
	2. Inferior PT gland comes from 3rd pharyngeal pouch
5. Adrenals
	1. medulla and cortex
	2. Medulla is from [[neural crest cells]] (1 of 3 ectodermal subtypes)
	3. Cortex is from LP mesoderm
6. Pancreas
	1. ?
	2. ?

Connections:
- urogential ridges
	- adrenal glands "Develop medial to the urogenital ridges"
# Notes

## Pituitary


## Pineal

## Thyroid


## Pharyngeal arch derivatives



Paryngeal pouch derivations
- 4 pouches -> endocrine glands
	- migration can leave deposits of cells along the way (patho?)


## Adrenal Glands

- cortex vs medulla
- hormones secreted important in fetal stage too

Definitive cortical cells
- etymology worth being aware of


## Pancreas
