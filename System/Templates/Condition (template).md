[[05.4.2 Overview of GIT pathology (Pathology)]] p32
> Clinical: Acute appendicitis
> • “Classic” presentation:
> – Onset over hours, constant mid-abdominal pain which shifts later to right lower
> quadrant, worse on movement
> – Anorexia (loss of appetite), nausea and vomiting
> – Most commonly in teens to middle age.
> • Adults with appendicitis symptoms more likely to have a neoplastic cause, either
> intraluminal or peritoneal surface
> • Typical clinical signs:
> – Low grade fever, diminished bowel sounds, tachycardia, leukocytosis
> (neutrophilia)
> – Other possible signs: Rovsing sign (press the left side of the abdomen and pain
> occurs in the RLQ), rebound tenderness
> • Early on can be hard to diagnose, lingering appendicitis can be missed
