# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts

- metabolism of glucose and glycogen
- glycogen storage
- 'importance' of glucose homeostasis in **key organs** (what happens if not homeostatic?)
- blood \[glucose\]
	- range
	- hormones (*insulin*, *glucagon*, adrenaline)
	- importance
- key enzymes (and how they are impacted by hormones)
- pathways

# Notes

\[gluc] = 5mmol (range of 3 - 8 in health)

glycogen glucose pyruvate
glycogenesis / glycogenolysis
glycolysis / gluconeogenesis

Liver 
- hexokinase traps glucose (and other 6 carbon sugars) inside cell
	- phosphorylates and adds/changes charge
- Phosphorylation(glucose) => Glucose 6-P 
	- trapped in liver
- Liver hexokinase no. 4 (glucokinase) can still work in the presence of lots of its product
- 5 glucose pathways to know about in liver (S6)
	1. ...
	2. ...
	3. ...
	4. ...
	5. PPP makes NADPH
		1. activated when we've got lots of glucose to make NADPH
		2. NADPH is needed in anabolism
		3. PPP also makes Ribose-5-phosphate (important nucleotide)
