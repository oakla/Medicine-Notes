- Pretty rare
- most of the time we don''t know what causes it
- caused by blockage that traps bacteria inside where they proliferate a lot
- Progression:
	- distension of lumen
	- inflammation spreads (i.e. neutrophils spread)
		- eventually leads perotinitis

**Classic pain pattern/presentation**
- central abdo pain then travels to **right ilac fossa**

Same inflammation elsewhere won't be as painful - Pain is worse because the appendix is small => pressure builds up

> **Clinical**: Acute appendicitis
> • “Classic” presentation:
> – Onset over hours, constant mid-abdominal pain which shifts later to right lower
> quadrant, worse on movement
> – Anorexia (loss of appetite), nausea and vomiting
> – Most commonly in teens to middle age.
> • Adults with appendicitis symptoms more likely to have a neoplastic cause, either
> intraluminal or peritoneal surface
> • Typical clinical signs:
> – Low grade fever, diminished bowel sounds, tachycardia, leukocytosis
> (neutrophilia)
> – Other possible signs: Rovsing sign (press the left side of the abdomen and pain
> occurs in the RLQ), rebound tenderness
> • Early on can be hard to diagnose, lingering appendicitis can be missed
