# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

- ALT and AST

## Key Terms & Concepts
- LFT analytes
- Presentations and course of liver disease
- Acute Hepatitis
	- what are the LFT signs
- Serum Fibrosis markers
- Cholestasis 
	- Cholestatic Jaundice

# Notes

## ALT and AST
markers of acute liver injury
- Alanine aminotransferase
- Aspartate aminotransferase
AST is a bit more specific to muscle 

AST:LST ratio is often looked at


ALP is non-specific
- e.g. comes from bone

## ALP, GGT and bilirubin

Bilirubin
- conjugated (direct) vs non-conjugated (indirect)
- conjugated => liver
- non-conjugated => 
	- high haemolysis
	- conjugation dysfunction



## Disease/Conditions/Presentations Covered

- Cholestasis
- 
- [[Jaundice]]
- Prutitis
- Liver Fibrosis

# Questions

## My Questions
## Revision Questions

Formatives provided:

- What tests are performed when you request “liver function tests?”
- Name the transaminases (also called aminotransferases). What information do they provide?
- What are the markers of cholestasis?
- List eight tests that (depending on the clinical presentation) could be considered in a patient with acute hepatitis, and provide the justification for each.
- List at least two causes for each of:
- increase in GGT
- increase in ALP. What tests can be done to investigate this?
- increase in AST
- increase in bilirubin
- decrease in albumin and other plasma proteins
- How could you distinguish liver from bone (or other) ALP in a patient with isolated increased ALP?
- Give two causes of unconjugated and two causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.
- How is conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia defined?
- Name one serum fibrosis panel and three causes of chronic liver disease in which it could be useful.
- Name a first- and second-line serum liver fibrosis panel currently recommended for use in Australian guidelines.
- What non-liver screening tests should be performed in a patient with MAFLD?
