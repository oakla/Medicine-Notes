# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

- ALT and AST

## Key Terms & Concepts
- LFT analytes
- Presentations and course of liver disease
- Acute Hepatitis
	- what are the LFT signs
- Serum Fibrosis markers
- Cholestasis 
	- Cholestatic Jaundice

# Notes

## ALT and AST
markers of acute liver injury
- Alanine aminotransferase
- Aspartate aminotransferase
AST is a bit more specific to muscle 

AST:LST ratio is often looked at


ALP is non-specific
- e.g. comes from bone


Bilirubin
- conjugated (direct) vs non-conjugated (indirect)
- conjugated => liver
- non-conjugated => 
	- high haemolysis
	- conjugation dysfunction
