## Recoil
Recoil (ability of tissue to return to it's original shape) is a factor in *some* restrictive lung diseases **and** *some* obstrictive lung diseases (OLD). In emphysema (an OLD), alveolar walls have been damaged or destroyed which impairs the airways ability to stay open under pressure, leading to air trapping


## Air Trapping
Air trapping occurs in OLDs due to airway collapse during expiration. The cause of airway collapse can differ; loss of alvelor walls and elastin fibres in emphysema, and mucus pluggin in chronic bronchitis
