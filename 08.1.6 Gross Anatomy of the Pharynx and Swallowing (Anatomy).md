# Overview
## Learning Outcomes

## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts
- Laryngopharynx

# Notes

## Nasopharynx
- between choanae and distal end of soft palate
- choanae made by medial pterygoid plates
	- space between those and septum between
	- at back of nasal cavity
- contains
	- auditory tube
	- levator palatine
	- salpingo-pharyngeus (yanks on tube to equalize pressure)
	- adenoid tonsil (aka pharyngeal tonsils)
		- inflammation can block air passage

## Oropharynx
- soft palate to palato-glossus muscle (CN.X)
	- includes posterior 1/3 of tongue
- contains
	- uvula
	- palato-glossus muscle 
		- (CN.X)
		- travels laterally to inferior tongue sides
		- creates fold
	- palatine tonsil (behind p-g m.)
	- palaton-pharyngeus
	- median and lateral glosso-epiglotic folds
	- valleculae (vallecula)
		- capture fuild as seen in sallow imaging

## Laryngopharynx
- Area posterior to larynx
- Contains:
	- Epiglottis
		- food moves around it as the food push it to close over the trachea/larynx
	- Ary-epiglottic folds
		- muscles here - they remove the folds to improve the seal - they don't close epiglotis
	- Arytenoid cartilages
	- Piriform recesses
		- you can get food lodged here
		- little triangular space (depression/recess)
	- Posterior edge of thyroid laminae
	- Posterior aspect of the cricoid lamina
		- smooth area made by crycoid cartilage - only complete ring
	- Holds vocal cords


pharynx ends at the bottom of ....

## Pharyngeal Skeleton
- Medial pterygoid plates
	- Posterior border of nasal cavity
	- Anterior boundary of nasopharynx
- Pterygomandibular raphe
- Mandibular tuberosity – pterygoid hamulus
- Buccinator & superior constrictor connection: Potential space that allows the
pharynx to move during swallowing
: origin of pharyngeal raphe
- Just in front of foramen magnum
Hyoid bone
- Greater and lesser horns
- 3rd arch and 2nd arch, respectively
- Stylohyoid ligament &muscle
Thyroid cartilage
- Prominence anteriorly (Adam’s apple)
- Superior and inferior horns posteriorly
Cricoid cartilage
- L-shaped, not just a ring
- Cricothyroid m. tenses vocal cords


## Constrictor Muscles

posterior points of greater horn mark middle constrictor with sup and inf either side
