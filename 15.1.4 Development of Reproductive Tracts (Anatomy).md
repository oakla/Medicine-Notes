In males, the **[[mesonephric duct]]** becomes the internal genital tract (rete testis, efferent ductules, epididymis, vas deferens (ductus deferens), and seminal vesicles) which connect to the semniferous tubles

In Females (XX):

    In the absence of the SRY gene, the gonad develops into an ovary, and no testosterone or significant AMH is produced.
    Due to the lack of testosterone stimulation, the mesonephric duct system degenerates.
    The absence of AMH allows the paramesonephric ducts to develop into the female internal genital tract (fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and the upper part of the vagina).
    Small, non-functional remnants of the mesonephric ducts may persist in females, such as the epoophoron, paroophoron, and Gartner's cysts/ducts, usually found within the broad ligament of the uterus or lateral vaginal wall.
