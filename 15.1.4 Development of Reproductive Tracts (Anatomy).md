## Males
- In males, the **[[mesonephric duct]]** becomes the internal genital tract (rete testis, efferent ductules, epididymis, vas deferens (ductus deferens), seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts) which connects to the semniferous tubles.
- The rete testis, efferent ductules, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts all originate from intermediate mesoderm

## Females
In Females (XX):
- In the absence of the SRY gene, the gonad develops into an ovary, and no testosterone or significant AMH is produced.
- Due to the lack of testosterone stimulation, ==the mesonephric duct system degenerates==.
- The absence of AMH allows the paramesonephric ducts to develop into the female internal genital tract (fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and the upper part of the vagina).
- Small, non-functional remnants of the mesonephric ducts may persist in females, such as the epoophoron, paroophoron, and Gartner's cysts/ducts, usually found within the broad ligament of the uterus or lateral vaginal wall.

## Tom's Summary
- The development of the genital duct system is closely related to the development of the urinary system.
- Gonads develop from a mix of cells from different embryonic lineages, (PGC’s from epiblast, and somatic support cells from IMM and LP.M)
- The mesonephric (Wolffian) duct is the main duct in the male reproductive system, and explains the connection of the reproductive system to the urinary system, as it has ‘hijacked’ what was a urinary pipe.
- The female duct system is derived from the paramesonephric duct, which develops from an invagination of coelomic epithelium (LP.M) and form the uterine tubes (a specialised cloacal pore that is continuous with the peritoneal cavity). It fuses caudally, to form the uterus, cervix, and upper vagina. If the fusion does not occur correctly, many variant morphologies can develop, all of which reduce reproductive success. There are contributions to the reproductive tracts and glands from the endoderm.
- The gonad and external genitalia begin as indifferent, until gene express changes them, which is mainly governed/initiated by the SRY gene. This is the reason for the gubernaculum controlling the descent of the gonad in both sexes, but the presence of the paramesonephric duct prevents the gonad from becoming externalised in the female.
- The testes being externalised is an adaptation for thermoregulation, to keep sperm viable, as they are highly active cells that create a lot of ROS and require a slightly lower temperature for optimal viability.
- The complex interplay between all aspects creates a large zone for sexual variation that isn’t entirely male nor female, but intersex. Some of which is transient, some not.
