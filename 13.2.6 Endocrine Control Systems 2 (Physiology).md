# Overview
## Learning Outcomes
- Describe the **HPA** and **HPG** axes
- Be familiar with the types of **enzymes involved in steroid synthesis.**
	- Understand the of role of **StAR in steroidogenesis**, and the roles of **P450s and HSDs** in determining which steroids are made and where.
- Describe the functions of **mineralocorticoids** and **glucocorticoids**
- Outline abnormalities associated with **impaired adrenocortical function**
- Describe the production, regulation and function of **sex hormones**
## Outline/Sections

## Key Terms & Concepts


# Notes
## enzymes involved in steroid synthesis
- Transforming ==**cholesterol** to **pregnenalone**== requires two enzymes;
	1. **StAR**: transports cholesterol from the outer to inner mitchondria membrane (where the next enzyme is)
	2. **p450scc** (CYP11a1): converts cholesterol into pregnenolone, the first steroid precursor
- **Pregnenolone** is the precursor to all other steroids. There are 2 types of enzymes involved in the transformation:
	- Cytochrome P450s (CYPs)
	- Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs)

## Corticosteroids and the Adrenal Glands
The adrenal glands are two really separate endocrine organs.
- cortex and medulla
- The adrenal cortex secretes **corticosteroids**
- The adrenal medulla **catecholamines**

### The Adrenal Cortex
- ==the adrenal **cortex** secretes corticosteroids==
	- **mineralcorticoids**, 
	- **glucocorticoids**,  
	- **precursors to sex hormones**
- ACTH mediation of corticosteroid secretion is part of HPG axis
- of the 3 corticosteroids, ACTH mediates glucocorticoids secretion more than the other 2

The adrenal medulla secretes **adrenaline** and **noradrenaline** (catecholamines)
